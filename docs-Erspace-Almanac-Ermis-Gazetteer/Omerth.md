The capital city of the [[Dyaarchy|Dyaarchy]] (and unoficially of [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis/index|Ermis]]). It is the set of autocratic power on the planet. It hosts [[./The-Arkanum|The Arkanum]] and the [[./Gn-st-rion|Gnōstērion]]. It is also the residence of [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis-Pyntarch-s-Lives/The-Dyad|The Dyad]]. 

It exists solely due to the great technological and magical powers of its wizards and technomancers. Otherwise gravity at the center does not exist, and powerful electromagnetic currents would arc uncontrolled through the area.
