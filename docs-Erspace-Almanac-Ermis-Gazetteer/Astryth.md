Astryth is one of two major cities on [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis/index|Ermis]], sister to the city Eryth. It is the original home of [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis-Pyntarch-s-Lives/Vires|Vires]]. Astryth is slightly smaller than [[./Eryth|Eryth]] but also has a more varied surrounding landscape, encompassing, plains, mountains, desert, and forest. The core of the old city is located at the southern base of the [[./The-Spar|The Spar]]. 

Astryth consists of  multiple levels as it carves its way up the foot of the Spar. 

It also has an "undercity", which is a network of passages and sewers that lead throughout the city. The undercity is also connected to the so-called "underdark" which is a deeper network of caverns and tunnels that lead into the mountains. From both the undercity and the underdark one can find passages leading to the tunnels of the [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis-Creatures-Curiosities/Sil|Sil]] in the northern wastes of the [[./Kypar-desert|Kypar desert]].
