The Arkanum is both a building located at the capital, [[./Omerth|Omerth]], and the body of wizards and technomancers serving the Dyarchy that reside within it. It strictly regulates the use of magic throughout [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis/index|Ermis]]. It also the source of all the know-how for building the capital city and maintaining it at the center of the Spire.

The Arkanum is contrasted with the [[./Gn-st-rion|Gnōstērion]], which is the clerical order of Eremis.
