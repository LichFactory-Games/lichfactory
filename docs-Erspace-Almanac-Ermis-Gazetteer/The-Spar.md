The Spar is the great rock column that spans the diameter of [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis/index|Ermis]]. It consists of extremely dense rock and is approximately 25 miles in width (it has an irregular cylindrical shape). It is the primary trade way for [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis/index|Ermis]]. 

[[./Omerth|Omerth]] is located at the mid-way of the Spar. The Spar itself also hosts the train or funincular that transports most goods between [[./Eryth|Eryth]] and [[./Astryth|Astryth]].
