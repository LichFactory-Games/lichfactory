The God of [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac/index|Erspace]] and the planet of [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis/index|Ermis]]. Er is considered to be all that is -- the being of everything. All is Er and Er is all. Â  Because this religion is montheistic but also pantheistic there is a sense of all the universe being subject to Er or the manifestation of Er. As [[../docs-Erspace-Almanac-Ermis-Pyntarch-s-Lives/The-Dyarchy|The Dyarchy]] discovers the wider wildspace and interspace systems these are taken to simply be further opportunities to manifest the faith of Er.  Er is considered a God of the prime material plane. This might seem to be a limitation of Er. But worshippers of Er consider the Prime material to be sole reality and of all other planes to be derivative or emanated from this prime reality.
