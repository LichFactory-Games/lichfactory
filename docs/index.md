Welcome to the Lich Factory, the home for all my ttrpg game info and resources. Here you'll find:

- The adventures "Ad astra" and "Per aspera" that I am writing for use at my table, along with whatever game-related stuff I'm blogging about. 
- DM Tools I use, including random generators, tables, and easy access to core rule info
