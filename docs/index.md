Welcome to *LichFactory Games*, the home for all my ttrpg game info and resources. Here you'll find [my blog](https://lichfactory.com/cryptography/) on game-related stuff including adventure writing, game design and game hacks, and whatever other things I think of. I also am slowly creating [Games and resources](./Games-And-Resources/index.md) for various games here as well. 

I host on a subdomain of this site containing resources related to a 5e campaign I'm currently running called [Ad Astra](https://adastra.lichfactory.com). 

I also make the occasional module for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). You can check out what I'm working on over at my [Github Site](https://github.com/LichFactory-Games).
