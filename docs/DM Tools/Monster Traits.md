| 20  | Inspire Troops              | Reaction              | When this creature succeeds on a saving throw or when an attack roll against them misses, one ally who can see this creature gains 5 + 1/2 CR temporary hit points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Leadership    |

The creature can cast up to two spells this turn, including two spells that aren't cantrips.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Magic         |
| 25  | Aura of Demise              | Trait                 | Each enemy within 30 feet of this creature who makes a death saving throw does so with disadvantage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Necromantic   |
| 26  | Aura of Destruction         | Trait                 | Each creature who ends their turn within 5 feet of this creature (or within 10 feet of this creature if this creature is CR 12 or higher) must make a death saving throw, regardless of their current hit points. With three successes, a creature no longer needs to make death saves against this effect. With three failures, a creature dies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Necromantic   |
| 27  | Undying Allies              | Trait                 | When an ally who can see this creature is reduced to 0 hit points, that ally immediately becomes a zombie (retaining their original stat block but gaining the undead type), and stands up with 1 hit point. From that point on, if damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead. Any ally who becomes an undead from this trait is destroyed if this creature dies or is destroyed. | Necromantic   |
| 28  | Withering Blow              | Bonus Action          | The next time this creature hits with an attack, the target takes 5 + CR necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. The target can make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 CR) at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success. The effect also ends if this creature dies or is destroyed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Necromantic   |
| 29  | Poisonous Demise            | Trait                 | When this creature is reduced to 0 hit points, they release a spray of poison. Each creature within 30 feet of this creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 CR) or take 2 + CR poison damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Poison        |
| 30  | Virulent Poison             | Trait                 | This creature's attacks that deal poison damage ignore a target's resistance to poison damage. If a target has immunity to poison damage, that target instead has resistance to poison damage against this creature's attacks. Additionally, the first time each turn that this creature deals poison damage to a target, that target is poisoned until the end of their next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                       | Poison        |
| 31  | Impersonate                 | Bonus Action          | Until the start of their next turn, this creature changes their appearance to look exactly like another creature who is within 5 feet of them and is no more than one size smaller or larger than this creature. Other creatures must each make a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC = 10 + 1/2 CR) each time they make an attack against this creature or the impersonated creature. On a failure, the attack is made against the wrong target.                                                                                                                               | Rogue         |
| 32  | Nimble Reaction             | Reaction              | When this creature is the only target of a melee attack, they can immediately move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If this movement leaves this creature outside the attacking creature's reach, this creature avoids the attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Rogue         |
| 33  | Bloody Legendary Resistance | Trait                 | If this creature fails a saving throw, they can choose to succeed instead. Each time they use this trait, this creature takes 4 + CR damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Solo          |

| 35  | Magic Resilience            | Trait                 | Whenever this creature is subjected to a spell or other magical effect that does not grant a saving throw, the creature can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, avoiding the effect on a success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Solo          |
