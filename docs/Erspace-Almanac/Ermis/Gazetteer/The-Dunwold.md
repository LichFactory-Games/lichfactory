A large forest in southern Vardoun. The Dunwold separates the major coastal towns from Astryth and the wider Strythian Plains. The Dunwold is a major source of timber for shipbuilding as well as general construction. Occasional conflicts with the Sylweards arise due to worries about deforestation. 

There are roads into the Dunwold, but there is as yet no major road entirely through it, though hiking through the Dunwold remains the quickest way to get from the coast to Astryth. 

The Dunwold is made much of in story and rumor. There is many a tale of travelers disappearing into its depths, not to be heard from again. The Faeir are often blamed for these disappearances, though they are more likely to try to help travelers through the Dunwold than to strand them within it. Nevertheless, the forest is considered a dangerous place. One does not travel through its heart unprepared.
