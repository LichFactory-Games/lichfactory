The Gnōstērion designates both a sacred building in the capital city, [[./Omerth|Omerth]], and the religious orders that reside in it. 

The Gnōstērion contains two orders -- the [[Dynamisai|Dynamisai]], or the Clerics of Er, and [[../Factions-&-Fellowships/The-Gnostari|The Gnostari]], which are the [[Psion|psionic]] arm of the Dyarchy. Both orders are known for their religious zealotry.
