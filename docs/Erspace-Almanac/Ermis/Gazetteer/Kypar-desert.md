The desert wastes covering roughly the middle of the continent of Vardoun. They are nested in between the Vardoun mountains and are home to [[../Creatures-&-Curiosities/Sil|Sil]]. The deep desert is home to creatures too dangerous to easily catalogue. There are also rumors of passages in the desert that lead deep into the ground below the surface of Ermis.
