## Traits

### Age

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

### Size

Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Hunter's Intuition

When you make a Wisdom ([Perception](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/skills.md##Perception)) or Wisdom ([Survival](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/skills.md##Survival)) check, you can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Finder's Magic

You can cast the [hunter's mark](../spells/hunters-mark.md#) spell with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the [locate object](../spells/locate-object.md#) spell with it. Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Finding Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
