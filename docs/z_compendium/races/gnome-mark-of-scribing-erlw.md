## Traits

### Age

Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

### Size

Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

### Darkvision

Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Gnome Cunning

You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.

### Gifted Scribe

When you make an Intelligence ([History](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/skills.md##History)) check or an ability check using [calligrapher's supplies](calligraphers-supplies.md#), you can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Scribe's Insight

You know the [message](../spells/message.md#) cantrip. You can also cast [comprehend languages](../spells/comprehend-languages.md#) once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [magic mouth](../spells/magic-mouth.md#) spell with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Scribing Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
