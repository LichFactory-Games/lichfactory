# Power Word Heal
*9th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is [charmed](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##charmed), [frightened](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##frightened), [paralyzed](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##paralyzed), or [stunned](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##stunned), the condition ends. If the creature is [prone](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##prone), it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**Classes**: [Bard](../classes/bard.md#), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](../classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md#)
