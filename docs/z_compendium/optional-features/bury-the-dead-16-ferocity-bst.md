# Bury the Dead (16 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29* 

When you and your companion are within 5 feet of a creature, you can use an action to cause a vicious whirlwind filled with debris and dirt to rise around the creature, which must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes `8d6` bludgeoning damage, is knocked [prone](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##prone), and is [restrained](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##restrained). On a success, the target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##prone) or [restrained](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##restrained). A creature [restrained](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##restrained) this way can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your exploit save DC, freeing themself on a success.
