You can activate this exploit whenever you take the Attack action. The first time you hit a creature with a weapon attack this turn, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##poisoned) until the start of your next turn.
