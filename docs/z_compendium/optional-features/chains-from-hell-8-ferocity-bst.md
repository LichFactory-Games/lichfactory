# Chains from Hell (8 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 38* 

As an action, you manifest fiery chains that attempt to wrap around up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes `4d6` fire damage and is [restrained](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##restrained) until the end of your next turn. On a success, a target takes half as much damage and isn't [restrained](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##restrained).

When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to `5d6`.
