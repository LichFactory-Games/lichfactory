### Beast Vitality (Level 3)

At 3rd level when you choose this bond, your connection to your companion increases your natural vitality. Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

### Pack Phalanx (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you and your companion learn to engage foes up close to keep them from harming those you protect. Whenever you and your companion are not [incapacitated](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##incapacitated) and are both within 5 feet of a creature, that creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against any target that is not you or your companion.

### Thickened Hide (Level 7)

At 7th level, your companion's natural defenses improve, making them harder to hurt. Your companion's AC increases by 2.

### Sentinel Companion (Level 11)

At 11th level, your companion's fierce vigilance drives them to attack cowards who attempt to harm other members of your pack. When a creature within 5 feet of your companion makes an attack against a creature other than you or your companion, you can spend 2 ferocity to have your companion use their reaction to make a signature attack against the attacking creature.

### Undying Protector (Level 15)

At 15th level, your companion's rage sustains you through grievous injuries and staggering blows. If you can see your companion when you drop to 0 hit points, you can spend 2 ferocity to drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the ferocity cost increases by 2. When you finish a short or long rest, the ferocity cost resets to 2.
