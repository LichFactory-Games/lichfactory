# Haste
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a shaving of licorice root
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the [Attack](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/actions.md##Attack) (one weapon attack only), [Dash](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/actions.md##Dash), [Disengage](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/actions.md##Disengage), [Hide](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/actions.md##Hide), or [Use an Object](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/actions.md##Use an Object) action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
