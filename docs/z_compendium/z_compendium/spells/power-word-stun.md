# Power Word Stun
*8th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [stunned](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##stunned). Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The [stunned](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md.md##stunned) target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

**Classes**: [Bard](../../classes/bard.md#), [Sorcerer](../../classes/sorcerer.md#), [Warlock](../../classes/warlock.md#), [Wizard](../../classes/wizard.md#)
