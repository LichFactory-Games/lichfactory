# Destructive Wave
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `5d6` thunder damage, as well as `5d6` radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [prone](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##prone). A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##prone).

**Classes**: [Cleric (Tempest Domain)](../../classes/cleric-tempest-domain.md#), [Paladin](../../classes/paladin.md#)
