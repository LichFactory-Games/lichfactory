## Description

Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and waterâ€”these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie's magic.

A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years.


## Traits

### Size

You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

### Unending Breath

You can hold your breath indefinitely while you're not [incapacitated](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##incapacitated).

### Lightning Resistance

You have resistance to lightning damage.

### Mingle with the Wind

You know the [shocking grasp](../../spells/shocking-grasp.md#) cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [feather fall](../../spells/feather-fall.md#) spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Starting 5th level, you can also cast the [levitate](../../spells/levitate.md#) spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast [feather fall](../../spells/feather-fall.md#) or [levitate](../../spells/levitate.md#) with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
