## Description

Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and waterâ€”these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie's magic.

A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years.


## Traits

### Size

You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

### Fire Resistance

You have resistance to fire damage.

### Reach to the Blaze

You know the [produce flame](../../spells/produce-flame.md#) cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [burning hands](../../spells/burning-hands.md#) spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [flame blade](../../spells/flame-blade.md#) spell with this trait, without a material component. Once you cast [burning hands](../../spells/burning-hands.md#) or [flame blade](../../spells/flame-blade.md#) with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
