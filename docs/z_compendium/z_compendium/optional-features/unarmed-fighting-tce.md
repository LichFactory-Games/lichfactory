# Unarmed Fighting
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 42* 

Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to `1d6` + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a [shield](shield.md#) when you make the attack roll, the `d6` becomes a `d8`.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal `1d4` bludgeoning damage to one creature [grappled](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##grappled) by you.
