# Ghostly Gaze
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 56* 

As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have [darkvision](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/senses.md##darkvision) if you don't already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your [concentration](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##concentration) ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.

Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
