# Bait and Switch
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 42* 

When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn't [incapacitated](../../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##incapacitated). This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.
