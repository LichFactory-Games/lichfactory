## The Beastheart

Erupting out of the sand on the back of a bulette, a half-orc leaps into the air. They cleave a path through armored skeletons with a greatsword while their mount charges in the opposite direction, leaving a cloud of powdered bone in their wake.

A halfling flies over a burning forest on the back of a baby green dragon. The wyrmling sniffs the air and cries out, pointing with a claw to indicate a safe path to lead fearful forest creatures through the conflagration.

Sneaking upside down next to their giant spider companion, a half-elf's web-covered feet keep them securely attached to a cavern ceiling. The bandits below have no idea that their camp has been infiltrated, and that their days of attacking local settlements are at an end.

A beastheart is an adventurer who forms a bond of friendship with a wild creature, and who draws power from that bond as it strengthens over time. Working as a team, a beastheart and their faithful companion can take on even the most dangerous adventures, challenging any monsters and overcoming any obstacles.

### Supernatural Bond

The connection a beastheart and a companion share isn't just one of love and admiration. It's a mystical bond that allows the beastheart to harness their companion's fury, might, and instincts for survival. When their companion is enraged, a beastheart channels that ferocity into supernatural deeds of martial prowess. In return, the wild companion can harness the beastheart's focus and direction.

This supernatural kinship can form over a long period of time. Some beasthearts bond with unorthodox pets or wild protectors as children, becoming ever closer as both grow up together. Other beasthearts come of age in the wilderness, raised among wild creatures—or even raised by them—as a means of learning to respect and embrace the might of nature. But the beastheart bond can also form more quickly, typically in times of great duress. A person lost and starving in the wild might become a beastheart when they connect with a creature that saves their life by providing food and shelter Or a wild creature injured and beset by poachers can befriend a character who saves their life, with the creature's gratitude forging the beastheart bond.

Not every person is cut out to become a beastheart, just as not every animal is meant to be a companion. The pair must share an innate wildness and an unwavering trust in order to form this rare fellowship.

### Companions, Not Pets

Most beasthearts have no desire to fully tame their wild friends, for doing so would rob beloved companions of their personalities and fighting spirit. Instead, a beastheart views themself as a caregiver, looking after a companion whose heart is as fierce and open as their own. The companion shares a similar view, thinking of their beastheart as a member of the pack, and treating a caregiver as a sibling always ready to explore, hunt, and play.

### Wild at Heart

To an outsider, a beastheart and a companion might appear to be equals (The companion most likely feels that way!) But the beastheart is always aware that their companion is a force of nature, not a domesticated creature. As such, a beastheart accepts that their companion might not be capable of deep introspection, as most companions live for the moment, dwell not on the past, and give little thought to the future. It's thus the beastheart's responsibility to do those things for themself and their wild friend, taking responsibility for a companion as a parent might care for a child, and grieving if the wild heart they've cared for is ever stilled.

### Untamed Pair

Like the companions who stalk and explore at their sides, beasthearts bear a wondrous connection to the natural world, allowing them to track prey, survive in harsh environments, and get along even with wild creatures that aren't their companions. Many beasthearts are most at home in the wilderness, sleeping under the stars and enjoying the bounty of nature. Even when beasthearts and their companions make their lives in towns or cities, the untamed wilds beyond a settlement or the subterranean depths beneath it are often on their minds, constantly calling them to adventure.

### Creating a Beastheart

As you create your beastheart character, consider the history of your friendship with your companion. Did you fnd the creature as a child and grow up together? Or did you form a bond with them only recently? Is this the first companion you've had, and are you the first person to whom your companion has bonded in this way? Think about the moment you became friends and the trials you've already faced. You might have survived in the wilderness together while one of you was injured. You might have saved your companion from trophy hunters. Or your companion might have instead saved your life by fighting off a deadly enemy.

Consider your companion's personality and tastes. Are they rambunctious or lazy? Standoffish or friendly? What tricks can you perform together? What is your companion's favorite food? You should also think about how your companion and you complement each other in looks or personality. Does your appearance reflect or contrast theirs? What activities do you both enjoy? How do you communicate with your companion? And how do you encourage others to communicate with and show respect for your friend?

### Quick Build

You can make a beastheart quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score (or Strength if you want to use a melee weapon), followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the outlander background.

## Class Features

### Companion (Level 1)

At 1st level, you gain a companion creature that accompanies you on your adventures, fighting, exploring, and living alongside you. You can choose any companion in this supplement or other MCDM supplements. You might also find some cool companions on the MCDM subreddit and in the MCDM Discord server. The Companions section has information on fifteen companion creatures you can choose for your beastheart, and information on the rules for using companions (including ferocity and entering a rampage).

Your supernatural connection to your companion binds their life to yours, allowing you to help your companion overcome even the most grievous injuries. If your companion has lost hit points or is dead, you can spend 1 minute meditating on your companion's spirit. The companion then regains all their hit points and returns to life if they were dead, and you gain one level of [exhaustion](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##exhaustion). If the companion's body was destroyed, they reform within 5 feet of you.

The first time you finish a long rest after you gain a level in this class, you can bond with a new companion of your choice, which arrives in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you in a manner determined by the GM. If you already have a companion from this feature, they leave to be on their own when the new companion arrives.

### Natural Language (Level 1)

From 1st level, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with your companion, as well as with all Beasts and Monstrosities. This feature doesn't allow you to communicate complex thoughts or questions, but you can make simple statements (such as showing other creatures you mean them no harm) or ask simple questions (such as the location of the nearest body of water, or if a specific individual with a unique look passed through the area recently). The knowledge and awareness of such creatures is limited by their intellect, and the GM determines if a particular creature is in a communicative mood. While speaking with a Beast or Monstrosity using this feature, you can make Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks in place of Charisma checks to influence the creature.

### Primal Exploits (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you learn to channel your companion's fury into extraordinary deeds called primal exploits, which are fueled by your companion's ferocity.

You learn three primal exploits of your choice, detailed below. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the primal exploits you know and replace it with another primal exploit, for which you must have the appropriate beastheart level.

Some exploits are activated using your reaction. Others are usable under specific circumstances but require no action. Some exploits are activated as part of the Attack action, in which case, you can use only one such exploit per turn.

All exploits require you to spend your companion's ferocity to use them. Your companion must be within 60 feet of you when you use an exploit, and must have ferocity at least equal to the exploit's cost. The companion loses ferocity equal to the cost when you use the exploit. You can use an exploit even if your companion is [unconscious](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##unconscious), as long as they have the appropriate ferocity. You can't use an exploit while your companion has entered a rampage.

Some exploits allow a companion to make a signature attack. This signature attack can't be modified with additional exploits or used as part of a ferocity action.

**Spell save DC**: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

You can take any of the following exploits when you gain this feature at 2nd level, or when you gain new exploits at 10th and 17th levels.

### Superior Ferocity (Level 2)

Also at 2nd level, whenever your companion uses a ferocity action that requires a creature to make an ability check or saving throw, the companion can use your primal exploit save DC in place of the normal DC.

### Companion Bond (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you choose a specialized bond that you share with your companion. Choose Ferocious Bond, Hunter Bond, Infernal Bond, Primordial Bond, or Protector Bond.

### Master Caregiver (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you already have proficiency in Animal Handling, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with the skill.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Beyond Instinct (Level 5)

At 5th level, thanks to your care, your companion's tenacity and versatility grow. You and your companion gain the following benefits:

- Whenever your companion gains ferocity at the start of your turn, they gain an additional 1 ferocity.  
- Your companion gains proficiency in saving throws with one ability score of your choice.  
- Your companion gains proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, or Survival. Your companion can use Wisdom in place of Intelligence when they make an ability check using the Investigation skill, and they can use Strength or Dexterity in place of Charisma when they make an ability check using the Intimidation or Performance skill.  

### Improved Signature Attack (Level 5)

At 5th level, when your companion hits with their signature attack, the attack deals one additional weapon damage die.

Additionally, damage dealt by your companion's attacks and ferocity actions counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

### Faithful Companion (Level 6)

At 6th level, your supernatural connection to your companion grows, allowing you to coordinate faster and to work better as a team with all your allies. You no longer need to use your bonus action to command your companion. Instead, as long as you are not [incapacitated](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##incapacitated), you can direct them to take an action simply with verbal or physical signs that require no action.

Additionally, when your companion enters a rampage when you are not [incapacitated](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md.md##incapacitated) and they can see or hear you, they do not automatically move toward and attack the nearest creature. You instead choose where the companion moves on your turn and which creature they attack with their signature attack.

### Rejuvenating Ferocity (Level 6)

Also at 6th level, your companion can draw on their own fury to revitalize themself during a battle. You can use a bonus action to spend any amount of your companion's ferocity, with the companion regaining hit points equal to the ferocity spent. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once), regaining all uses when you finish a long rest.

### Companion Bond Feature (Level 7)

At 7th level, you gain an additional feature from your Companion Bond.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 8)

When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Primal Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with primal energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage to the target. The damage type is determined by you when you gain this feature, and is chosen from the following list: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can change the damage type for this feature to another type from the list.

### Mystic Connection (Level 9)

At 9th level, your connection to your companion grants a natural talent. The benefit of your Mystic Connection depends on your companion. If you ever gain a new companion, your new companion's Mystic Connection benefit replaces the old one.

***Basilisk.*** As a bonus action, you cover your skin in a flexible layer of stone that lasts for 10 minutes. While coated in stone, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. You can't use this benefit again until you finish a long rest.

***Dragon Wyrmling.*** As a bonus action, you imbue a weapon you hold with draconic power for 10 minutes. While this power is in effect, attacks made using the weapon deal an extra 1d10 damage of the type associated with your wyrmling's Draconic Lineage trait. You can't use this benefit again until you finish a long rest.

***Earth Elemental.*** As a bonus action, you transform your body into dirt and stone for 10 minutes. While in this form, you can walk through nonmagical objects made of earth or stone. If you end your turn inside an object, you take `1d10` force damage and are shunted back to the space from which you entered the object. You can't use this benefit again until you finish a long rest.

***Gelatinous Cube.*** Your body becomes flexible and gelatinous. As an action or bonus action, you absorb a Tiny object you hold into your body, so no one else can access it. As an action or bonus action, you can then excrete an absorbed object into one of your empty hands or have it fall at your feet. You can absorb up to four objects at a time. Any absorbed objects fall out of your body when you die.

Additionally, when another creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use a reaction to deal `3d6` acid damage to the attacker. You can't use this benefit again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Giant Spider.*** You gain a secondary sense that warns you of danger. You have advantage on initiative rolls, and you can't be surprised while you are not incapacitated.

You can't use this benefit again until you finish a long rest.

***Hell Hound.*** As a bonus action, you shroud yourself in hellfire for 10 minutes. While you are shrouded in this way, any creature within 5 feet of that hits you with a melee attack or that touches you for the first time on a turn takes `2d6` fire damage. You can't use this benefit again until you finish a long rest.

***Mimic.*** As a bonus action, you touch a Small or smaller nonmagical object and polymorph it into any other nonmagical object of the same general size and weight, and whose value cannot exceed the value of the original object. The object remains polymorphed for 1 hour If you move more than 30 feet away from the object, the polymorph ends early, or you can choose to end it early as an action. Using any material polymorphed in this way as a spell's material component causes that spell to fail. You can't use this benefit again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Owlbear.*** As an action, you let loose an inspiring hoot. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear you gains temporary hit points equal to your character level. You can't use this benefit again until you finish a long rest.

***Sporeling.*** When you hit another creature with a weapon attack, you infuse the attack with special spores that impose disadvantage on the target's attack rolls until the end of their next turn. You can't use this benefit again until you finish a short or long rest.

As an action, you call out to the creatures, which arrive immediately and occupy a 30-foot cube centered on a point within 120 feet of you that you can see. The swarm persists for 1 minute. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to move the swarm up to 30 feet in any direction.

Each creature of your choice that starts their turn in the swarm's area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your exploit save DC or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and a −5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) score, until the start of their next turn.
