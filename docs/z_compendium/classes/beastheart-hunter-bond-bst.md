# Hunter Bond
*[Beastheart](./beastheart-bst.md#): Companion Bonds*  
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions*  


## Class Features

### Hunter Bond (Level 3)

You and your companion share a love of the hunt. The pair of you are silent stalkers working together to take down prey of all sizes, whether to feed your friends or to destroy your enemies. Many beasthearts with this bond use ranged weapons to attack prey from afar while their companion closes in for the kill.

### Chosen Quarry (Level 3)

Starting when you choose this bond at 3rd level, you and your companion can single out a creature as your prey. Whenever your companion gains ferocity at the start of your turn and doesn't enter a rampage, you can spend 4 ferocity to mark a creature within 90 feet of you (no action required). That creature becomes your quarry for 1 minute, or until you use this feature to mark another target as your quarry. Whenever you or your companion hit your quarry with a weapon attack or deal damage to them with a ferocity action, the quarry takes an extra `1d6` damage.

### Hunter's Instincts (Level 3)

At 3rd level, your instincts improve, making you a formidable tracker and granting you better intuition. You gain proficiency in the Survival skill if you do not already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using that skill, and you can use Survival instead of Insight when you make a Wisdom check to read a creature's intentions or discern if a creature is lying.

### Primal Warding (Level 7)

At 7th level, you learn to use primal magic to set traps made of nearly invisible force. As an action, you trap a 10-foot-square area of ground centered on a point you can see within 30 feet of you, with the trap lasting for 8 hours or until it is triggered. When you set the trap, you can designate any number of specific creatures that are unaffected by it. Finding the trap requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your exploit save DC.

A creature that walks into the trap's area triggers the trap and must make a Constitution saving throw against your exploit save DC. On a failure, the creature takes `4d8` force damage and is [blinded](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##blinded) for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##blinded). A creature [blinded](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##blinded) by the trap can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the trap when it is triggered. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. If you set more than one trap, you know which one was triggered.

You can use this feature to set a number of traps equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum one). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Synchronized Stealth (Level 11)

At 11th level, you and your companion learn to become unseen at the same time in the blink of an eye. When either you or your companion takes the Hide action, the other can take the Hide action as a reaction if they are able to hide. Additionally, when you take the Hide action within 5 feet of your companion, you have advantage on the Dexterity (Stealth) check made as part of the action.

### Unseen Hunters (Level 15)

At 15th level, you can use an action to make you and your companion [invisible](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##invisible) for 10 minutes. While [invisible](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##invisible), neither of you can be tracked by nonmagical means unless you or your companion chooses to leave a trail. Either of you can end the invisibility on yourself as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can use it again when you finish a long rest.
