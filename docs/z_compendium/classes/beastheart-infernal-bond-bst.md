# Infernal Bond
*[Beastheart](./beastheart-bst.md#): Companion Bonds*  
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions*  


## Class Features

### Infernal Bond (Level 3)

You and your companion share a deep connection with each other... and with the Seven Cities of Hell! It might be that you work in the service of a devil, that you both spent time imprisoned in Hell before clawing your way out together, or simply that you bonded with a fiendish companion born in the Lower Planes. Whatever the case, you are connected to the Seven Cities and can use your companion's ferocity to unlock infernal magic.

### Devil's Understanding (Level 3)

Starting when you choose this bond at 3rd level, you can speak, write, and understand Infernal.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Arcana or Religion skill (your choice) if you do not already have proficiency in those skills.

### Infernal Exploits (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you gain one infernal exploit of your choice, which functions in the same manner as your primal exploits and uses your exploit save DC as applicable. The exploit you choose must be one available at 3rd level.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the infernal exploits you know and replace it with another infernal exploit, for which you must have the appropriate beastheart level.

**Infernal Exploits: 3rd Level**

| Exploit | Action Used | Ferocity Cost |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Drain Them | Reaction | 4 |
| Hellish Wound | No Action | 4 |
| Infernal Teleport | Action | 4 |
| Wicked Deception | Action | 3 |

### Hell's Charmer (Level 7)

At 7th level, your companion can harness the supernatural charm of devils to work enchantment magic on other creatures. As an action, choose one creature that can see you and your companion within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, doing so with advantage if you or your allies are fighting them. On a success, the creature knows you tried to charm them and becomes hostile toward you and your companion. On a failure, the creature is [charmed](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##charmed) by you and your companion for 10 minutes, or until you or your allies do anything physically, mentally, or emotionally harmful to the creature. The [charmed](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##charmed) creature is friendly to you. When this effect ends, a [charmed](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##charmed) creature doesn't remember what happened during the time they were [charmed](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##charmed).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once). You regain all uses when you finish a long rest.

### Fiendish Traits (Level 11)

At 11th level, your companion's connection to Hell causes them to become more fiendish. Choose one of the following traits for your companion:

- ***Barbed Hide.*.** Your companion grows barbs all over their body. When a creature within 5 feet of your companion grapples them or hits them with a melee attack, that creature takes `1d10` piercing damage.  
- ***Fiendish Immunities.*.** Your companion's skin, fur, or other coloring turns red, and the companion is immune to fire and poison damage and to the [poisoned](../../Rules%20&%20Options/5e%20Rules/conditions.md##poisoned) condition.  
- ***Fiery Weapons.*.** Your companion's natural weapons, such as teeth or claws, become sheathed in black fire. Whenever your companion hits with their signature attack, the attack deals an extra `1d6` fire damage.  
- ***Wings.*.** Your companion sprouts leathery wings from their back and gains a flying speed of 40 feet. If your companion already has wings, those wings take on a fiendish look and their flying speed increases to 40 feet.  

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace your companion's fiendish trait with another from this list.

### Infernal Exploits (Level 11)

You can take one of the following exploits when you gain a new infernal exploit at 11th level:

**Infernal Exploits: 11th Level**

| Exploit | Action Used | Ferocity Cost |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Brimstone Teleport | Action | 8 |
| Chains from Hell | Action | 8 |
| Dark of Hell | Action | 8 |
| Infernal Flames | Action | 8 |
| Poison Rain | Action | 8 |

### Fiendish Form (Level 15)

At 15th level, your companion can become a scale-covered child of Hell. As a bonus action, you can spend 6 ferocity to transform your companion into a fiendish form for 1 minute. While in this form, your companion undergoes the following changes:

- They are a fiend.  
- They have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.  
- They have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
