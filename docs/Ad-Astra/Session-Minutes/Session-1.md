## Exposition

Night is approaching. The group of travellers, guided by the faeir [[../../../Celin Lothvari (NPC)|Celin Lothvari (NPC)]], make their way not so silently through [[../Player's-Almanac/The-Dunwold|The Dunwold]]. With every crack of a twig, or crunch of a leaf, Celin does little to hide his disdain at the group of beings he's been contracted to lead through *his* forest. 

'At least they are better than the last party,' he thinks as the forest quiets down and the dim sunlight through the trees fades away. "Dusk is upon us. We will camp here." Crouching down, he works to quickly build a fire. Behind him, he fails to notice the individuals each mocking him with serious looks and silent, sarcastic repeats of his grim lines. As he gets the embers going, he turns, and everyone abruptly looks idle. The faeir narrows his eyes, and proclaims in his haughty tone, "I will fetch us bounty from the woods. Keep that fire going."

As Celin began walking away, one of the party members slowly followed him. Gloopwing, the plasmoid who looks like a pink lizard who became inflated similar to a glass figurine, decided to take the jeering a step further. A pseudopod limb darted from between the trees and dropped a speckle of decaying leaves above Celin's head. When the faeir stops abruptly to scrutinize the trees above for a tricky squirrel, another pseudopodic limb reaches out with a leaf covered in sap and quickly, but gently, sticks it to the back of his head. A quick turn, and Celin eyes Gloopwing picking up rocks and giving a particular shiny one a whistle in approval. Deciding that this group is really nothing but trouble Celin runs, not jogs or walks, away from the camp.

Utterly pleased with its deception, Gloopwing shuffles back to the camp site a few paces away. But, not before quickly nabbing an unfortunate squirrel from a nearby oak. *Dinner Time!*

Around the campsite, the Master-of-all-that-is-human-punching, Karel began setting up the tents with the similar Master-of-all-that-needs-tinkering-by-Dhampir, Stigs the stiff. Gloopwing settles on a nearby log next to the doloi wizard, Gwenzahlya. In the background, the lithe Ryalith practiced their way through a series of punches and kicks. The doloi toyed with a pack of cards, whose ornate background caught the eye of the plasmoid. Generating another pseudopodic limb, Gloopwing tagged a leaf and attempted to stick it to the back of the cards. The doloi was quicker, and pulled the objects closer to her chest. Then, as if deciding something, the wizard fanned out her cards and said "Pick one."

Without hesitation, the limb stuck the leaf to the back of one card. The closest one really, in the plasmoid's view. To Gwenzahlya, however, it was something else entirely. "This.. this is the Knight of Swords." The doloi looked up and became aware that the entire camp was looking at her, and so she explained. "The knight of swords means that they are very brave. But it also can mean danger is near."

Just as the words left Gwenzahlya's mouth, Celin appears with some fruit and fungus. As the party looks at him suspiciously, he sighs and sets down the food before proceeding to throw more kindling on the fire because no one, absolutely no one, had attended to it. "Keep this alive," he told him. "If we want to survive the night we need to stay near the fire." He passes by the doloi, glances at one of the cards still fanned out, and yoinks it away from the rest. A purse of the lips and he drops it, which Gwenzahlya snatches up. 

> [!danger|p+l txt-c]- The Tower: A warning, upheaval, or betrayal.
> Is our guide a trustworthy friend, or a foe?

Gwenzahlya mused on the implications of the card. She clutched the chosen card fervently before waving a hand. Out from her clothes came a vibrant, multicolored snake. "Prince Slithy. Can you take a look around for us?" Without an answer, the snake slid off into the underbrush.

## Encounter: Elk Brigade

A short while later, the shriek of an owl preceded the rushed slithering of Slithy back to their owner. While Gwenzahlya soothed the multicolored reptile, Celin peered into the darkness with even more narrowed eyes (if such a thing was even possible). A crack of twigs. A quieting of the forest. For a few seconds the thud of hooves was hear, along with the tortured shrieks of the animals. In another moment a herd of Elk burst into the clearing, their cloven hooves muted by the dense collection of old leaf litter.

> [!statblock-astra]- Elk
>*Large Beast, unaligned*
>___
> The Elk hit hard when scared, but were otherwise fairly docile and certainly very dumb -- for example, they seemed easily susceptible to Gwenzahlya's illusions.

One elk, the leader, pushed ahead of the rest  and rushed towards the fire. Celin, knowing the danger should that fire go out, worked to intercept and calm the beast. The elk was not having any quarter for the faeir, and reminded him of his place as it delivered a hoof kick to his chest. Gwenzahlya rushed to Celin's aide. Gloopwing, also striving into action, extended numerous pseudopodic limbs and waved them around like strands of sea kelp, or the strange delicacy known as "ruh-men noodle." The elk turned, preparing to deliver another kick but hesitating at the presence of this strange and unusual creature. While it was distracted, Ryalith, ever itching for a fight, and aided by Gwenzahlya innate fey knack for help, jumped in the air and landed on the elk's back with a twisting flourish – because why the heck not? 

Startled, out of its element, and deciding it picked the wrong fight, the elk took off with a jaunt with Ryalith still attached. Unfortunately, the elk managed to trample an empty tent as it ran off.

The rest of the herd, left behind, themselves slowly approached the fire. Karel stepped in front of the now closest one, and with a great heave, pushed it aside. Now nervous of the strange, two-legged creature, this elk veered off into the forest after its leader.

The other three elk seemed to debate taking residence next to the fire. Celin pushes himself to his feet, and Gwenzahlya turns her attention to the approaching elk. Joined by Prince Slithy, she begins casting a strange magic. The elk, seeing an illusory snake created by Gwen, reared in instinctual panic. Gloopwing and Stigs intercepted. While the Dhampir shimmied up the tree to take much needed aim if the elk decided to charge, Gloopwing once again changed its form to look … nothing like an elk but its best interpretation of an elk. In return, the elk gave Gloopwing the cervidaean equivalent of '*WTF are you?'*, decided these creatures were just as deadly as what it was running from. 

The fourth elk looked uncertain if it should stay, or should it go; the fire was its source of protection. Gwenzahlya and Celin gave it no chance to think about settling in as they shoo'd it off. 

After witnessing the results of what happened to its 4 bro's, the fifth and final elk slowly walked away. As it walked back into the depths of the forest, it passed nearby the returning Ryalith, victorious from her elkian gymnastics. Stigs, from his makeshift perch, puts away his unused crossbow and begins making his way down the tree. Gwenzahlya peered up at the taller Celin. 

"What caused that" the doloi asked, thinking back to the Tower on the card. Behind her, Karel began fixing up what he could of the camp.

"An injury," Ryalith replied. "That one had a large gash on it."

"A slash," Stigs corrected as he joined Karel in fixing what he could. "There was a bloodtrail I saw from the tree. We'd be able to follow it."

"We should stay by the fire," Celin insisted. 

Ryalith, who began stretching out after the nice warmup of elk riding, grimaced. "No chance. We should go and get what hurt that elk before it gets us."

Karel sighed as he tossed the shredded remains of a tent. "I'm game."

Celin pointedly sat down next to the fire. Gwenzahlya turned to look at Gloopwing who was returning to their normal, blob lizard form. "What do you think?"

"Fire." The plasmoid said without hesitation as its 'mouth' reformed. Not that it was going to tell the others that *someone* needed to watch Celin. 

Gwen joined with Ryalith after Ryalith teased her, and was part of the search in the woods suggesting they search by torchlight. When the searching by torchlight discovered the Night Hunter, Gwen ran back to gather the rest of the party to join in fight.  

## Encounter: The Night Hunter

Not even a minute later, the yell of Stigs entered the clearing, followed by a hollowed shriek. Karel and Ryalith race to the sound of Stig's voice as he fends off the attack of… The Night Hunter!

> [!statblock-astra]- The Night Hunter
>*Medium humanoid , chaotic evil*
>___
> The Night Hunter enjoyed toying with the party. It was incredibly stealthy. It hid in the forest shadows and only came out to attack when it helped to terrorize the group, or when the party had been split. It attacked fiercely with two slicing cuts of its cursed knife. 
> The Night Hunter also seemed to exude shadows -- they split off of it as it took our hits. 

The Night Hunter slashed at Stigs with an old and bloodied knife, twice. The first missed, but the second caught the dhampir across his front. Gwenzahlya, leaving the safety of Celin in Gloopwings capable oozy claws, stepped lightly and swiftly towards the source of the trouble. As she exited the treeline into another clearing where Stigs was dodging and cradling his oozing wound, she fanned and shuffled her Tarot deck and created a Temporal Echo. The echo  shimmered and flickered as if Gwenzahlya was in many places at once, she then continued on with her next spell, a Chill Touch. A spectral Valkrye like figure appeared from the aether and reached out for the attacking shadowy being. Though the spectral hands missed their target, Karel burst from the Night Hunter's flank, and delivered two punishing blows of his fists. 

The Night Hunter doubled over, and the ice claws brushed harmlessly past its target. The shadowy being's visage warped, it shimmered, then drew in the light as it expelled from its core a smaller version of itself; darker than the night itself.

> [!statblock-astra]- Shadow Fragment
>*Medium undead (?), chaotic evil*
>___
>The shadows came at us as we attacked the Night Hunter. Fortunately none managed to get their "hands" on us, though it seemed they might drain the very life from our bones if they did. They also seemed fairly delicate -- Gloopwing destroyed one with a single bolt from their crossbow. 
>And we were fortunate that Ryalith encouraged us to focus our attacks on the Night Hunter, for though the shadows split from it furiously to surround us, once the Night Hunter was defeated the shadows vanished into the forest night. 

And then another shadow exited The Night Hunter and swiped at the incoming Ryalith. The fierce pugilist snarled in annoyance. *If her fists were going to hit lighter, she would just have to punch faster!* As she moved to implement her rage, the The Night Hunter took the opening to make two attacks of its blade, leaving Ryalith in a state of seething.

While this had been going on, Gloopwing and Celin had stayed near the fire. When the sounds of battle became apparent, the plasmoid gave the faeir a look, took some nearby leaves with a limb, and dropped them above their head. With the admission of their guilt freed, the plasmoid left the safety of the fire. Using growing limbs to project itself along, Gloopwing reached the clearing quickly. Ryalith was attempting to dodge the attacks of a large shadow striking with a weapon, and a smaller shadow was flaking from her side. A decision made, the plasmoid ejected their small crossbow from their arm pores and shot at the shadow. The bolt connected, and the shadow squealed, drawing the attention of The Night Hunter and its other shadows. Gwenzahlya took her chance, casting another Chill Touch over towards The Night Hunter. A spectral young girl circled by birds,  and the birds swooped into strike. Unfortunately the Night Hunter proved evasive still.  

Stigs, finally recovered from the initial ambush attack, cast a Cure Wounds on himself. 

The Night Hunter reared back. Its shadows circled around it as they regrouped. They turned to face the group as one and advanced, but for the roar of a creature behind them. The Night Hunter turned in time to see the snarling face of an angry Celin attempting to shove his sword into The Night Hunter's wound.  A miss! Taking advantage of the opening, Karel gave one more punishing strike and the shadowy being discorporated, its robe settling slowly in the air onto Karel's arm. The shadow fragments faded into the mist, as if they never existed. 

## Exegenesis

No one needed convincing to return to the fire. While it was invigorating to fight, it also was a closer call than anyone was comfortable with. Everyone had a goal to make it through the forest alive, and so as they returned to the small, dying fire, each one began throwing dried wood and leaves to stoke it back to life. A short time later, Celin left ahead to "procure the bounty of the forest", and he omitted what had been his usual derisive comments. The group talked amongst themselves, and settled in, with Gloopwing resuming first watch. 

By luck or destiny, six individuals come together and triumph against the horrors of the night.

## Homework Before Next Session

- Think about why your character is heading to Astryth. Are they from there? Do they know someone there? Why would they brave the Dunwold for such an opportunity? 
- Make sure basic background is fleshed out (i.e traits, bonds, flaws, ideals)
