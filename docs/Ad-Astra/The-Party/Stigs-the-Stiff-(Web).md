**Biography:**  
Stigs "The Stiff" Svenson, a shipwright for House Orosen, is a thickly built, 6'6" tall man with distinct dhampir features, including red eyes, pale skin, and pointed ears and teeth. Despite his imposing appearance, Stigs is an awkward, rambling gearhead. His condition as a dhampir arose from a failed experimental procedure, leading to his dependence on external electricity. He's deeply loyal to his mentor and is consumed by conspiracy theories and a perpetual state of paranoia.
