**Biographical Information:**  

Gwen grew up in a world steeped in arcane rituals and the tyranny of her mother. Yet, she found companionship and solace among the creatures of the natural world, such as snakes, toads, and insects. These unlikely friends taught her the art of poison and sickness, leading Gwen to master magics like poison spray and ray of sickness. Despite her mother's influence, Gwen's innate connection to nature and her inquisitive spirit preserved a core of goodness within her.

Gwen's life took a turn when she discovered a fairy tale about a brave Prince who defied an unjust King, inspiring her to choose a path of goodness over evil. In defiance of her heritage, she ran away, eventually joining a troupe of travelling performers. This new family taught her the "Five Mystical Omens to Live By," the art of Tarot reading, and how to captivate audiences. Embracing her newfound freedom and identity, Gwen transformed from a child of darkness into a beacon of light and joy, sharing her gifts and talents wherever her journey took her.
