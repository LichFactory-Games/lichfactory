  - I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder, like my fascination in the beauty of refracted light in the crystal jewelry I handcraft. 
  - I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules, having been raised/adopted by a family of traveling performers, acrobats, musicians and wonderful eccentric talented people.
  **Independent Thinker**. I trust my own intuition and deduction much more than any authority.
  I find the mysteries of time and space to be utterly compelling. The more a place promises answers, the more I am drawn to it.
  **Deeply Superstitious**. I believe in my ability to interpret the Tarot symbolic signs to reveal truths about people, places and things in my world in the present and future.
