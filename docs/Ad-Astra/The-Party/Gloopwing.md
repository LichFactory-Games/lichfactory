## Biographical Details

Gloopwing, like many of her plasmoidic kind, was born alone. The two dollops of DNA that made her formation first congealed in a ruin of some type. Her first sight was the dark shadows of stone. But when the cascading rays of the star lit her surroundings, it revealed a picture of creature on a wall. As the nameless blob fixated upon the image, her form changed, shifted, and became what she saw.

Over time, the ruins which became her home began to crumble further, with all the constant intrusions by people who dirtied her space. She mostly ignored them, except when they approached her kin on the wall. After one particularly close call, she made the decision to take the facade and leave the ruins and search for more of her kin.

In her journeys, she recently came across a strange Doloi holding gems the seemed to match some of the baubles shown on her picture of her kin. She decided to follow them, and ended up getting sucked up into an adventure.
