# Introduction: Welcome to Ermis

Ermis is a world of magic and technology in a near seamless blend. Some level of magical knowledge is common amongst all the people of Ermis, though its use at higher levels of power is strictly regulated by the Arcanum. Magic and technology are largely taken to complement one another rather than compete. Technomancy is at the basis of the economy of Ermis, and the capital city of Omerth, floating high above the rest of the world, would not exist without it.

Adventuring in Ermis is not for the faint of heart. The great houses are in a permanent cold war with one another -- held in check solely by the power of the Dyarchy and the forces of the Hegemonium that it commands. The twin cities of the Spar, Eryth and Astryth, are places of intrigue and opportunity. The wonders of Haem, to the north, are well-known, and the Faeir Wildes to the west are as inviting as they are shrouded in mystery.

Campaigns set in Ermis easily accommodate political intrigue, exploration, horror, and high fantasy. The structure of Ermis is unusual. It is a hollow planet. Everyone lives in the interior, and there is no visible \"sky\" or \"stars\" as we know these things. Instead there is the Strom, a fast-moving and electrically charged cloudcover that moves a few miles above the surface of Ermis. It is the primary source of light on Ermis. There is also the Spar, which is an enormous natural stone structure that reaches miles high into the \"sky\" of Ermis, penetrating through the Strom. The cities of Eryth and Astryth sit at the bases of each end of the Spar. At the center of planet, between the two ends of the Spar, sits Omerth, the floating city. Trade between the twin cities, along the Spar, forms the backbone of the economy of the Dyarchy, and is a major source of its power and influence in Ermis.

## A Brief History of Ermis

Ermis has had a tumultuous history. The origins of the various peoples of Ermis are largely unknown, though there are rumors of a \"great secret\" held by the Dyad and members of the Faeir council, concerning the nature of Ermis and its people. What is known from recorded history is that settlements near the ends of each part of the Spar became major powers, concentrated in the hands of the great families or houses of each city, and forming a kind of mercantilist oligarchy. However, this system was inherently unstable, as each house vied with the others for control of goods flowing through the Spar. There were also military incursions into Haem and the wilds of the Faeir. This instability culminated in a war that raged over all of Ermis. From this war no clear victor emerged. Instead the house system itself partially collapsed, and with it the oligarchy it sustained. In its place the Dyarchy emerged. The Dyarchy is the result of the merger of bloodlines from the two greatest houses of the old Astrythian and Erythian orders, resulting in the \"two-who-are-one\" -- two beings who are deeply mentally and spiritually linked. They and their descendants have kept the peace now for centuries.

The Faeir have largely withdrawn into themselves and their wildes, while Haem maintains trade relations with the Dyarchy. Though Ermis has enjoyed several hundred years of relative peace and stability, recently things have taken a turn. Strange events and curious beings have started to appear throughout Ermis. There are rumors of terrifying beings that reside in the great trenches to the north of Eryth and in the wastes of the Kypar Desert

The Dyarchy has also become increasingly authoritarian. Its forces tightly regulate the use of magic and artifice. The forces of the Hegemonium have turned increasingly to the naked exertion of force over its citizens for the sake of order and secuirty. The future of Ermis appears poised for great change. These are interesting times.

The dominant religion on Ermis is that of Er. This is a monotheistic religion in which Er manifests in different forms, but is understood to constitute all of reality. The priestly and clerical orders of Er are the \"Erathoi.\" Clerics of Er are (at least typically) Lawful Neutral, reflecting Er\'s ordered but impersonal nature. The worshippers of Er interpret all references to gods other than Er as references to Er under some guise or attribute. Other factions, such as the Faeir, find this very irritating. 

## Geographic Overview

![[../../assets/img/Ermis-world-map.jpg|Ermis-world-map.jpg]]

There are three megacities on Ermis. These are the cities of the Dyarchy (also known as the "cities of the Spar") Eryth and Astryth (known also as the "twin cities"), and the capital city of Omerth (a floating city at the center of the world). 

Other major cities or city states include Kavouri and Tehmérr (major seaports, independent of the Dyarchy), Thalassia in the Faeir Wildes (the seat of the Council of the Faeir), and Caer Mynydd (the northern center of the Haem Collective). 

The primary deity worshipped on Ermis is Er. The Dyarchy recognizes no other deity and contend that all other gods are simply aspects or appearances of Er. 

There are many other smaller settlements, including agricultural and shipping centers near the twin cities, and nomadic groups such as the Sil, who live in the wastes of the Kypar desert. The desert is largely left to the Sil and whatever terrors live in the deep desert. 

Kra Chora is largely unexplored by humans, though the Haem have their great city of Caer Mynydd nestled in the Kra'Aav mountain range. There are stories of icy monuments made by an unknown hand.

Ignis is a blackened land. Much of it seems made of a glass like material. There are rumors that giant lizards live there. But these are usually dismissed as mere stories – the fancies of sailors and fools.
