# Factions of Ermis

The Dyad and the five great houses are by far the most significant political and economic factions on Ermis and together they form the governing body of the twin cities -- the Synod. The political structure of the twin cities resembles in some respects that of a constitutional monarchy (in this case a Dyarchy), but the Dyad has ultimate authority and the rest of the Synod is more advisory in nature. However, because the Synod exists in part to resolve disputes between the houses peacefully, as well as to address outside threats, there is a significant investment by all in an at least an appearance of respecting the established norms, practices, and rulings of the Synod.

The Dyad (or the Dyarchy more broadly) also commands a number of other large organizations. These are the martial forces of the Dyarchy -- the Hetai -- and the spiritual forces of the Dyarchy -- the Dunamisai. The Dunamisai contains two further organizations, the Erathoi, composed of clerics, and the Gnostari, composed of psions. 

The other great powers include the Arkane, the Council of the Fair and the Haem Collective. The nomadic Sil, that live in the wastes, are rumored to also have some sort of broader political structure, but their organization is largely unknown. There are also various important religious groups (Eranism, The Followers of the Opener) and crime syndicates (The Five Knives, The Crows, The Red Hand)

## The Five Great Houses

Each of the great houses has a home base, but they have representatives present in all the major cities on Ermis. Their wealth and influence surpass that of any other groups.

### House Orosen ![[../../assets/img/orosen-gear2.png|left|150]]

Based in Eryth and led by Galenus Orosen, House Orosen is a powerful family of inventors and engineers. They are masters of both arcane and technological advancements, with their inventions being sought after across Ermis. They specialize in crafting automatons and golems, and their airships are the fastest and most advanced in the skies. They have a long-standing rivalry with House Hyperion, and have increasingly chafed at the strictures put on them by the Dyad.  

### House Valtor ![[../../assets/img/valtor-hammer.png|left|150]]

House Valtor is led by High Arcanist Daedalus Valtor. They nominally follow Er but truly value profit and prestige. The house is based in Eryth and combines elemental magic and engineering to pioneer construction innovations.  

### House Hyperion ![[../../assets/img/hyperion-book.png|left clear|150]]
 
House Hyperion is led by Archmaga Cassandra Hyperion. They fervently revere Er and value collecting esoteric magical knowledge. The house's ancestral towers and libraries are based in Eryth as well as an ornate, palatial family estate, and they seek to advance the arcane arts through research and cement their magical dominance. House Hyperion is known for their magical prowess and their control of the arcane. They, along with House Tethys, are responsible for the magical defenses of the twin cities and often act as advisors to the Dyad and the Arkanum.  


### House Tethys ![[../../assets/img/tethys-compass.png|left |150]]



House Tethys is led by Lord Enchanter Ptolomus Tethys. They fervently venerate Er and value collecting arcane artifacts. The house (an ancestral palace and vaults) is based in Astryth and seeks influence through controlling magic artifacts.  

### House Xeryth ![[../../assets/img/xeryth-chisel.png|left clear|150]]



House Xeryth is led by Grand Engineer Hexia Xeryth. They nominally worship Er but truly value ingenuity, profit, and prestige. The ancestral halls and workshop are based in Astryth, on a lavish estate, and the house seeks to pioneer construction innovations to maintain economic dominance. They are primarily responsible for the original train design for the Spar, and are responsible for its upkeep and expansion.  

## The Council of the Faeir ![[../../assets/img/tree-faeir.png|left|150]] 

The Council of the Fair is a confederation of independent fair folk that come together periodically to share knowledge and resources. Each circle is led by a powerful Fair creature with unique abilities and skills, and decisions are made through consensus rather than formal voting. The Council's main goals are to preserve and protect the natural order of Ermis, and to ensure that the faeir folk can continue to exist and thrive in the face of the increasingly powerful and authoritarian Dyarchy. They are rumored to communicate with each other through a network of enchanted trees and stones scattered throughout the forests and mountains, and they rarely interact with other races unless such interaction furthers their own, often inscrutable, ends.  

## The Haem Collective ![[../../assets/img/lamp-haem.png|left|150]] 

The Haem Collective is a loosely organized group of artisans and engineers who are dedicated to the pursuit of innovation and progress. Highly skilled mechanics and craftspeople who specialize in the creation and maintenance of advanced machinery and technology, Haemin believe that the key to improving the lives of *all* Ermisians lies in the development of new technologies and the application of magic in practical ways. The Haemin are known for their ability to build devices that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. They are guided by a philosophy of communalism and mutual aid, and they often collaborate with other factions in Ermis to share their expertise and resources. Despite their anarchic structure, the Haemin have a reputation for being reliable and trustworthy, and their services are in high demand among the wealthy and powerful in Ermis Their main hub is located in the city of Mykonia, where they maintain a massive laboratory and workshop complex that is open to all members of the collective. The Haemin are fiercely independent and tend to resist outside influence, but they are always willing to collaborate with other groups who share their values.

## The Arkane ![[../../assets/img/arkane.png|left|150]] 

The Arkane are the premier magical society of Ermis. They are nominally under the rule of the Dyarchy, but they consider themselves an autonomous collective. They consist of wizards of all schools. However, one of their primary responsibilities (and sources of income) is in maintaining the functioning of the Spar transport system, as well as the various enchantments that allow Omerth to maintain its position floating at the center of the world. Hence, orimancers and kinemancers feature heavily in the Arkane. So too do the technomancers (artificers) that perform the various engineering feats required to keep travel along the Spar running smoothly.

The collective interests of the members of the Arkane nominally concern furthering the power of the Dyarchy and the word of Er. However, members of the Arkane are also quite likely to have their own interests, including the furthering of magical knowledge and power. House Tethys has great influence among various members of the Arkane due to its ability to procure unusual items of magic throughout the realm.

## Eranism ![[../../assets/img/eranism.png|left|150]]  

The Eran religion is centered on the worship and contemplation of Er, the singular substance that comprises the unity of all things. Er is equated with Nature and the totality of existence.

Followers of the Eran religion, called Erans, seek to develop an intuitive understanding of Er through reason, scientific inquiry, meditation, and ethical living. By using philosophy and science to comprehend the natural world, Erans deepen their perception of the divine order underlying all creation.

Erans have no dogma, clergy, or supernatural beliefs. Their practices emphasize self-cultivation, study, and intellectual reflection. Virtues such as wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice are developed in harmony with Nature. Passions are moderated through reason.

Local congregations are led by guides or "Hierophants", who have demonstrated profound wisdom and deep understanding of Er. Their role is to inspire learning and lead meditative practices, not prescribe morality. Congregants are called "seekers" ("Zētētai").

Contemplators gather in simple meeting halls to engage in silent meditation, philosophical discussion, and contemplative walks observing Nature. Most pursue secular careers and interests, coming together periodically for spiritual nourishment.

Ritual is minimal, with seekers sharing simple meals as an expression of unity. Music, poetry, and dance may be incorporated if conducive to contemplation. Eran holidays mark the changing seasons and equinoxes.

Erans seek mystical moments of transcendence through contemplation, but do not consider them necessary for spiritual fulfillment. Serene awareness of one's unity with Nature and Er is the goal. This awareness manifests naturally in a virtuous life.

The Eran religion welcomes all seekers of truth and universal understanding. It integrates scientific advancement and social progress into its dynamic conception of the Divine.

## The Followers of Hodos ![[../../assets/img/hodos-rings.png|left|150]] 

The followers of Hodos -- the so-called "opener of the way" -- are, in may respects, simply followers of Er. However they object to Eranism's restrictions and hierarchy. They reject its conception of the actual as the rational and the rational as the actual, of all things being as they must be. For them Hodos is the key and the gate. Hodos both knows the way and *is* the way. There is a kind of anarchism present in the followers of Hodos that is entirely alien to Eranism. The order is currently led by Zerrenia Azhar. 


# People 

## Er 

The God of Ermis. Er is considered to be all that is -- the being of everything. All is Er and Er is all.   Because this religion is montheistic but also pantheistic there is a sense of all the universe being subject to Er or the manifestation of Er. As The Dyarchy discovers the wider wildspace and interspace systems these are taken to simply be further opportunities to manifest the faith of Er. Er is considered a God of the prime material plane. This might seem to be a limitation of Er. But worshippers of Er consider the Prime material to be sole reality and of all other planes to be derivative or emanated from this prime reality.
