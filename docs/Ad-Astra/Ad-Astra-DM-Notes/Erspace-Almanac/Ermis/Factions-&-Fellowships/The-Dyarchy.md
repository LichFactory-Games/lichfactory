overview: |-
  "The" Dyarch is actually a title for the twin leaders of the Dyarchy, also known as "the two-who-are-one". Their heraldry is that of the Zephos -- the twinned blades. The blades are the signature weapons of the Dyad, but they are also used by high ranking members of the Hetai and the Gnostari.

  The Dyarchy has evolved from its roots as a means of keeping peace between the great houses, into a fascist theocracy bent on bringing order to all of Ermis. The creeping fascism of the Dyarchy has started to sow dissent amongst the Great Houses, not all of whom are willing to live under the putatively "rational order" of the Dyarchy as the expression of Er, the one god.
