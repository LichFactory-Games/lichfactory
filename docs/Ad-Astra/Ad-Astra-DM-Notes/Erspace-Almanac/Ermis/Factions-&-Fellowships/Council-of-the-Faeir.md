type: Confederation
leader: Aurvang the Ancient
organization: The Council of the Faeir is a loose confederation of independent faeir circles from across the faeir domains of Ermis. Each circle is led by a powerful faeir lord or lady possessing unique magical abilities and skills. The Council as a whole makes any important decisions through consensus and deliberation rather than a formal voting structure.
goals: The Council seeks to preserve and protect the natural primal order of Ermis. They aim to ensure the faeir folk across Ermis can continue to thrive and exist autonomously, without interference from expanding mortal societies like the authoritarian Dyarchy.
base: Thalassia
resources: The faeir have mastery over potent nature magics intrinsically tied to the land, forests, mountains, and waterways of Ermis which they call home. They use a network of carefully enchanted trees and stone circles scattered throughout their domains to communicate and transport themselves over long distances.
alignment: Chaotic Neutral
religion: Faeir Mysteries
allies: The faeir have some cooperation with druidic circles and shamanic groups across Ermis who share their reverence for nature, though they remain fairly isolationist overall.
enemies: The authoritarian Dyarchy, with its ever expanding settlements and exploitation of resources, threatens faeir autonomy and independence. But the faeir try to avoid being drawn into direct conflicts.
hooks: |-
  - Stop loggers and pioneers from encroaching on the Faeir Wildes and disrupting the balance. 
  - Broker some sort of peace agreement between the faeir and a frontier town expanding near their domains. 
  - Investigate strange and dangerous creatures that have started emerging from the wildes.
