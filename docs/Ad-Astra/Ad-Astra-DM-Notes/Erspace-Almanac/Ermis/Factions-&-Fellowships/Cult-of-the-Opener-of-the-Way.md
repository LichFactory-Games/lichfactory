The PCs will have to contend with [[../../../../../assets/img/5e-cthulhu-mythos-v8.pdf#page=153|The Cult of the Opener of the Way (PDF)]] (perhaps under some different title). 

## Cult of the Opener of the Way

The followers of Hodos are, in may respects, simply followers of Er. However they object to Eranism's restrictions and hierarchy. They reject its conception of the actual as the rational and the rational as the actual, of all things being as they must be. There is a kind of anarchism present in the followers of Hodos that is entirely alien to Eranism. 

Because of this anarchism, the Opener's followers are often lone sorcerers, wizards, or other outcasts who seek Yog-Sothoth's power and knowledge. They walk a reckless path, as the Opener wants them to help him return to the world, which would likely destroy everything mortal (though his followers often do not realize this). His worshipers view their role as support for the Opener and his minions: the god itself is supposed to do the greatest tasks while his worshipers merely assist.

Generally, followers of the Opener owe him their loyalty out of carnal obsession or familial obligation. Yog-Sothoth often breeds with them, producing outer mutants, abominations, or spawn. Thus, the follower's descendants can inherit the world.

At times, a group of like-minded spellcasters may band together under Yog-Sothoth's guidance for a short time, but the Opener's worship more often produces a wider, looser fraternity. Such a far-flung network involves wizards in several places, all working together, who maintain contact through periodic travel, sending of familiars, or spells. Joseph Curwen leads such a loose-knit group in Lovecraft's The Case of Charles Dexter Ward.

More importantly, Yog-Sothoth is a widely known entity among those who study the arcane, so wizards almost everywhere can access his powers, summon him or his servants (by mistake or otherwise), and try to tap into the arcane influence he commands. While Yog-Sothoth's own cult may be loose and small, other Mythos cults respect, fear, and speak highly of the entity himself. Almost any cult's members can access Yog-Sothoth's eldritch powers and summon his monsters. The Opener's purpose is always the same and quite direct—to expand his influence and enter the world.

## Gifts of the Opener

Cultists of the Opener might have access to any of the following benefits.

**Channel Power**. Many of the Opener's worshipers have great mystical might but lack physical strength. They can channel mystical power into their own bodies to gain physical strength and prowess when fighting. They favor spells like divine favor, ferox (see page 102), and magic weapons.

**Immortality**. The Opener can greatly extend the life of his worshipers, though there is always a cost. Always. The Case of Charles Dexter Ward contains one such cost: the horrific demise of one's descendants to allow for self-resurrection.

**Summoning**. The Opener can be brought physically (at least in part) to the mortal realm, where he can carry out his will, including the creation of outer mutants, abominations, and spawn (see page 351).

**They Break Through**. Yog-Sothoth's followers are more easily able to create gates to other places, or portals through which the Old Ones can come. In addition, the gates they create can often access times or realms unavailable to other cults. Followers of the Opener have an easier time procuring obscure material components or acquiring the sigil sequences for the plane shift and teleportation circle spells. If they are wizards, they favor the School of Ritualism (see page 61) for their Arcane Tradition.

**Time and Space**. When a cultist of the Opener is traveling through space or time via magic or technology, the Opener can act as a guide so they make no error, ensuring they arrive where they intend.

**Treasures**. Cultists often have access to Abhoth slime, gates, Plutonian drugs, space mead, and silver keys

The Cult of Hodos has been lead by [[../../../NPCs/Zerrenia-Azhar-(NPC)|Zerrenia Azhar (NPC)]] for many years. However recently [[../../../NPCs/Sāros-Karenikos-(NPC)|Sāros Karenikos (NPC)]] has overtaken Zerrenia as the primary personality in the cult. Their intentions have increasingly clashed and the future course of the Cult of Hodos is uncertain.
