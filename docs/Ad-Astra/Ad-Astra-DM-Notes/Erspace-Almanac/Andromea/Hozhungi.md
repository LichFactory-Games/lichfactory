The Hozhungi are one of two dominant social powers on Andromea, the other being the Neogi. The Hozhungi are a clan-based society with [matrilineal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineal "Matrilineal") [kinship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship "Kinship") groups. Children are considered born into the mother's family and gain their social status from her and her clan. Her eldest brother traditionally has a strong influence on rearing the children.

**Guilds and Trade Houses:** Various guilds and trade houses exist, each specializing in different aspects of the economy, such as mining, craftsmanship, agriculture, and caravan logistics. These organizations operate under a structured hierarchy, ensuring the efficient flow of resources and goods. Apprenticeships are highly regarded, with skilled craftsmen passing down their knowledge through generations.

**Marketplaces and Festivals:** Colorful and bustling marketplaces are scattered across the desert, often set against the backdrop of majestic rock formations and canyons. Festivals celebrating trade, craftsmanship, and abundance are held regularly. These events showcase the artisans' skills and the confederation's prosperity.

**Honoring Tradition:** Despite the focus on wealth, Hozhungi society retains a deep reverence for traditional values. Ceremonies, storytelling, and rituals that embody the essence of "hózhǫ́ǫ́gi" remain integral to their way of life, fostering a sense of cultural continuity amidst economic growth. However, this has the result that Hozhungi society is extremely conservative, both socially and economically. Most innovation is either the result of collective effort, or the charismatic actions of singular individuals shaping society according to their will. 

**Balance and Harmony:** In this society, the pursuit of wealth is always presented merely as a means to achieve greater balance and harmony with the land and its resources. Profits earned through trade are reinvested into the community's well-being, supporting infrastructure, education, and communal projects that contribute to the overall prosperity of the confederation. However, this is often merely appearance. There is an enormous amount of self-aggrandizement and diversion of resources into personal projects. This is generally socially accepted so long as there is some attempt to veil it in a presentation of "balance" and the social good.
