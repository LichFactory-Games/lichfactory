# Yog-Sothoth

> Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the [Old Ones](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Old_One "Old One") broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.

Yog-Sothoth is frequently said to be conterminous with all space and time. While this is undoubtedly true on some level, this terrifying entity cannot physically intervene in the waking world unless summoned. When a magical gate is opened for his passage, Yog-Sothoth can intrude into the mortal realms temporarily, to seek sacrifice or to advance his cause, but usually only as a fragment of his true self. For his whole reality to enter the waking world, a gate of colossal size must be prepared, that Yog-Sothoth might enter fully and bring about the end of the world. Fortunately for life and sanity, this is difficult to accomplish and requires significant work.

Yog-Sothoth is an utterly alien being, sometimes described as a congeries of spheres, but the reality is far more terrifying. These "spheres" are bladders or spawning sacs, and the whole is loosely knitted together with rootlets to form a semi-coherent body. The individual sacs can change their three-dimensional relationship with one another, and even operate normally when separated at a distance, but typically hang together. Sometimes Yog-Sothoth can separate a chunk of himself to act semi-independently and even travel in the mortal realm, but this typically lasts only for the length of time his gate passageway is opened (rarely more than a few hours). Yog-Sothoth is able to fly, travel between dimensions, and grant such travel to his minions and those who seek him out.

## Yog-Sothoth in Combat

That portion of Yog-Sothoth which reaches through a gate can attack by detaching globules from his body, which fly independently through the air and strike at his foes, or he can reach out with the tangled rootlets that form his internal structure, which become like antennae to strike. The touch of Yog-Sothoth brings about desiccation and death to the part of the body struck. His orbs and rootlets are otherworldly and multidimensional and literally pass through foes, causing damage internally as they do so.

Yog-Sothoth himself is not fully on any one three-dimensional plane of existence, and physical weapons have only a limited effect on him. If a portion of him is destroyed while extruded through the gate, he can always push more into the area. Yog-Sothoth's full size is at least hundreds of miles or kilometers across, so destroying a few cubic feet or meters of his local presence causes him little concern.

Yog-Sothoth has complete control of the magical flux within his environs. He might repurpose, modify, and/or redirect any spells cast in his presence, except for a few ceremonies powered by ancient artifacts of the Elder Gods or Great Old Ones themselves. A caster might maintain a spell through intense force of will, but this is rare. Yog-Sothoth's minions are well aware of this ability and typically cast spells recklessly in his presence, expecting Yog-Sothoth to turn all such spells into useful aids.

traits:
  - name: Influence 
    desc: Yog-Sothoth has an area of influence equal to 1-mi.-radius circle. All creatures in this area are subject to a DC 22 check agains unnamable doom. The Nucleas itself occupies a 15-ft. square space at a point within this influence. 
  - name: Projected Nucleus 
    desc: Yog-Sothoth’s influence is centered on a Huge physical or magical portal. A Huge mass of spheres extends from this portal and serves as Yog-Sothoth’s nucleus. While the nucleus can move, the influence remains centered on the portal. The nucleus can’t leave or be removed from the influence by any means. The portal has the same statistics as the nucleus, and damage to either one depletes the influence’s shared hit points.  
  - name: Dimensional Defense (1/Turn) 
    desc: The second weapon attack that hits Yog-Sothoth’s nucleus each turn passes through a portion of Yog-Sothoth that exists beyond the Material Plane. Yog-Sothoth has resistance to all damage from that attack and the attacker is exposed to extreme dimensional energy from the dimensional rift if the attacker is within 10 feet, taking 55 (10d10) damage of a randomly chosen type (1. acid, 2. cold, 3. fire, 4. lightning, 5. radiant, or 6. thunder). If the attack was made with a nonmagical manufactured weapon and the attack’s damage is halved in this way, the wielder must succeed on a DC 22 saving throw or the weapon is whisked away to some other plane or time. The saving throw uses the ability score that applied to the attack roll. A weapon lost in this way can be retrieved with a wish spell or divine intervention. 
  - name: Regeneration 
    desc: Yog-Sothoth regains 40 hit points at the start of each round if it has at least 1 hit point. Casting a spell such as private sanctum or forbiddance that blocks planar travel or teleportation anywhere within the area of influence causes this trait to stop functioning for the duration. This effect is foiled if the caster lost control of the spell to Yog-Sothoth’s Control Magic effect.
  - name: Susceptibility to Dimensional Blocking 
    desc: When a character casts a spell that blocks planar travel or teleportation that targets or includes the portal at the center of the influence, the influence loses 20 hit points per level of the spell.
actions:
  - name: Control Magic 
    desc: When a spellcaster casts any spell within Yog-Sothoth’s influence, Yog-Sothoth can opt to control the magic. In this case, the spellcaster must succeed on a spellcasting ability check (the DC equals 10 + the spell’s level) or Yog-Sothoth can immediately transform the spell into another one. If Yog-Sothoth transforms the spell, he can choose any other spell of equal or lower level from the same spell list, and Yog-Sothoth then makes all the decisions involving targeting the spell and any other choices required to resolve the spell’s effects. The converted spell uses the same level spell slot as the original casting.
  - name: Desiccating Touch
    desc: At the start of each round, Yog-Sothoth sends several spheres, roots, and filaments of his body through up to two targets within 20 feet of his nucleus. The target must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 101 (2d100) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the creature fails its saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced by half the damage until removed by a greater restoration spell or other magic. If a creature’s hit point maximum is reduced to 0, it dies.
  - name: Traverse
    desc: At the start of each creature’s turn in the area, YogSothoth can choose to give it a flying speed of 60 feet with the ability to hover as well as the innate ability to cast the spell teleport without expending a spell slot as a bonus action. These benefits last until the creature ends its turn outside the area.

## Defeat

Yog-Sothoth's influence can be defeated in one of the following ways.

**Combat**. If the influence is reduced to 0 hit points, it is defeated and vanishes.

**Portal Destruction**. The portal at the center of the influence is necessary for Yog-Sothoth's influence to remain in the world. The exact nature and defenses of such  portals varies from conjuring to conjuring and are left to the GM to determine, but in most cases destroying a portal should require the use of a special artifact, a dangerous ritual, or a certain set of conditions that require coordinated teamwork and several rounds of work. Physical destruction of the portal should be at least as difficult as destroying a heavily-fortified building or a small mountain.
