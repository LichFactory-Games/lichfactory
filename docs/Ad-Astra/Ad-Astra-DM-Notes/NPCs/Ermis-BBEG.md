The BBEG for the adventure is a trio of [[../../../../alhoon-mpmm|Alhoon]]. The have been "living" in the outer disk of Erspace for at least a millennium. The last of the [[../../../../mind-flayer|Illithid]] to survive the conflagration and its aftermath, they became undead in order to ensure their ongoing existence. They have been preying on the creatures of the disks for centuries, only (relatively) recently discovering that Ermis could support life in its hollow interior. 

The three Alhoon (the Triumvirate) have a hierarchy. The leader is an [[../../../../ulitharid-mpmm|Ulitharid]], and thus the most powerful and dangerous of the three. Their name is U'xulex, and they are roughly a 13th level mage. U'xulex is not on Ermis, instead leading from their base in the outer disk. Ideally U'xulex survives the adventure and escapes Erspace. The PCs will hopefully then run into him in later adventures, when he has ascended to full lichdom. 

The two Alhoon that the PCs will primarily deal with are C'thaxis and Qu'alanth. 

Since Erspace has been cut off from both the planes and from other wildspace systems it will take enormous power to allow the Alhoon to leave. This is where [[./Yog-Sothoth|Yog-Sothoth]] comes in. The Triumvirate will attempt to summon it and use its power to escape Erspace by rejoining it to the rest of the material plane. 

**Motivation**: The Triumvirate want to escape Erspace to allow them to travel, increase their power via exploration, and achieve true lichdom. They also realize that their long-term options are limited if they remain solely in Erspace. 

**Lackeys**: The Triumvirate have [[../../../../intellect-devourer|intellect devourers]], [[../../../../cranium-rat-mpmm|cranium rats]], [[../../../../brain-in-a-jar-vrgr|Brains in Jars]] and a variety of abominations created from their experiments over the centuries that they use to guard their lair and to enact their plans. 

Ideally a/the brain in a jar ends up being the pilot of the spelljamming ship as the PCs escape? But that depends on a lot of variables. Also hoping to have a baby Spelljammer as the actual ship in the end.
