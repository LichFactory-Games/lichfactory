history: |
  Thanatis has been first a seeker, then a guide, for the Erian religion, having become Hierophant at the temple in Hestia. He is an intellectual and curious by nature, and aspired to the temple at Hestia because of its age and proximity to various mysteries (the Dunwold and to seafaring travellers coming to and from the coast). 

  Some years ago he began to investigate the origins of the temple in earnest, and discovered an ancient series of caverns below the temple, including crypts of seekers of an age long past. He discovered fragments of script concerning rituals related to the temple's origin. This led him on a further quest for rare documents and artifacts. Eventually he discovered a ritual for the creation of the [[Runeskull|Runeskull]] and began his slide into corruption and madness. Thanatis is now a follower of Hodos the opener and is actively working to bring about Hodos's return. 
hooks: "A missing Hierophant! Zombie attacks! Animated skeletons! Kidnapped acolytes! "
details: "House Tethys seems to be heavily involved in getting materials to Thanatis. Perhaps they know nothing of what they have been shipping him, or perhaps there is someone in the House who is well-aware of the materials Thanatis has been acquiring and is actively supporting Thanatis. "
