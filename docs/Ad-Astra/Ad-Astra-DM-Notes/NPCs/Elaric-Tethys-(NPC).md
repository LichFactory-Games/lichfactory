## History

Elaric Tethys was once a respected and highly regarded scholar in House Tethys, known for his keen intellect and insatiable thirst for knowledge. He made significant contributions to various fields of study, including arcane lore and historical research. However, as he delved deeper into his research, his obsessions grew, leading him down a path of isolation and paranoia. His pursuit of forbidden knowledge and his unorthodox experiments eventually took a toll on his sanity, driving him to madness. The exact trigger for his descent remains a subject of speculation, with some attributing it to a cursed artifact he uncovered during his explorations. Whatever the cause, Elaric's mind gradually unraveled, and he was confined to a jail cell for the safety of himself and others.

## DM Notes
### Plot Hooks
- The players are approached by a member of House Tethys who seeks their help in understanding the cause of Elaric's madness and potentially finding a way to restore his sanity. 
- Elaric's delusions hold fragments of ancient knowledge and hidden truths. The players are tasked with deciphering his ramblings to uncover valuable information that could change the course of their current quest or reveal new secrets. 
- A rival scholar or organization seeks to exploit Elaric's madness for their own gain. The players must protect him from their machinations while navigating the treacherous waters of House Tethys' politics.

### Hidden Details
- Elaric's madness is not entirely without purpose. He occasionally utters cryptic phrases that hint at hidden locations, ancient artifacts, or forgotten rituals. These clues can lead the players to discover valuable treasures or uncover long-lost secrets. 
- In his moments of clarity, Elaric demonstrates a deep understanding of obscure magic and forgotten lore. He may be able to provide the players with valuable insights or even teach them rare spells if they can gain his trust and decipher his erratic speech.

### General Notes
- Elaric's condition is stable, but his mental state is unlikely to improve without external intervention or a significant event triggering a breakthrough. His delusions and bouts of madness can make interactions with him challenging, but there is still a flicker of his brilliance buried within his fractured mind.
