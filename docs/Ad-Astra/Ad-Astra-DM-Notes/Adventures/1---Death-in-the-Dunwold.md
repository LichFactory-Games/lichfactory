# Scenes
> [!columns|2 no-t]
> > [!warning|no-i c-gray]+ **The Howling**
> > - READ: *A keening howl rises on the wind from the surrounding forest.*
> > - Characters can tell the howl isn't a wolf, coyote, or other common forest creature. The character with the highest Wisdom score notices it sounds like a creature with a speaking voice â€” perhaps an intelligent being.
> > - Characters trying to rest won't be able to unless they pass a DC 15 Constitution check. 
> > - The howl draws closer over the next hour. As soon as it's within 100 feet of the camp, it abruptly stops.
>
> > [!investigate|no-i]+ **Rumors & An Owl**
> > - READ: *A crack and hiss echoes from the trees above camp just outside the reach of the campfire light.* Investigation reveals some broken branches and the spectacle of a great horned owl snapping the spine of a rabbit it just caught.
> > - Distribute [[1---Death-in-the-Dunwold#Secret and Clues|Secret and Clues]] randomly to the players around the fire 
> > - After the owl incident, a quiet hour passes. Then, it strikes 
 
> [!important|c-red]+ **It Strikes**
> - READ: *The silence breaks as a dozen thundering footfalls crash toward camp.*
> - The footfalls are a herd of six elk the Night Hunter spooked in the direction of the PCs' camp. They reach the camp in one round.
> > READ: *Two of the elk have deep, straight cuts bleeding down their necks and flanks. They're wild with fear.* 
> - PCs can calm individual elk with DC 18 Animal Handling checks (DC 20 for the two wounded ones).
> - While the PCs are distracted by the elk, the Night Hunter targets the character nearest the edge of the woods. It grapples it and drags it out into the woods, attempting to subdue it silently. The default character to be taken is [[../NPCs/Celin-Lothvari-(NPC)|Celin Lothvari (NPC)]].
> - PCs watching the pack animals can pass a DC 15 Perception check to notice the flash of a blade from the darkness, followed by the character slumping over. The **Night Hunter flees** if noticed. The slain animal leaves a bloody trail 60 feet out into the darkness, ending with its body. If the PCs don't have a pack animal, the Night Hunter carves a conspicuous series of X marks into a line of trees leading out 60 feet from camp. The trail ends with the body of an elk with its throat cut.
> - The elk spend 1d4 rounds wheeling around the campsite. They charge anyone who gets in their way or fails an Animal Handling check.
> - After the PCs regroup in camp, another quiet hour passes. The insects and birds have fallen utterly silent. The Night Hunter hides 100 feet from camp. 

> [!columns|2 no-t]
> > [!place|no-i c-yellow]+ **A Cry for Help**
> > - READ: *A terrified scream rips through the night. The voice is frantic and shrill, and it calls out for help in Common.*
> > - The Night Hunter is mimicking the voice of a person, trying to draw goodhearted PCs into the darkness.  If any PCs investigate, the Night Hunter attacks from hiding. Go to Combat. 
> > - Otherwise, the PCs listen on as the Night Hunter imitates the sounds of finding and disemboweling its victim. Any PCs hearing it must pass a **DC 15 Wisdom save** or suffer one form of [[../../../../short-term-madness|Short-Term Madness]]. Attempting to sleep through these sounds is impossible without a way to fully block the listeners' ears.
>
>> [!important|c-purple]+ **Combat w/The Night Hunter**
> > - The Night Hunter keeps to the fringes of combat and light, never fully revealing itself.
> > - It tries to knock one PC unconscious and drag that character off into the night to crucify to a tree with wooden stakes. It will return later to disembowel that PC after it finishes hunting the rest of the party. 
> > - A PC who returns to consciousness can escape the tree with a **DC 15 Strength check**. They must pass a **DC 15 Constitution** save or take 1d6 piercing damage in the process. 
> > - If the Night Hunter can't gain an upper hand quickly, it slips away into the darkness and hides. The Night Hunter leaves any captured PCs pinned to trees and even allows other PCs to find and rescue them.
> > - Two hours pass.

> [!columns|2 no-t]
> > [!important|c-orange]+ **The Butchery**
>> - READ: *Silence fills the heavy air, pressing in like the boiling clouds overhead. Dim moonlight turns the tops of the towering pine trees silvery white.*
>> - The Night Hunter approaches the camp silently, attacking any PC who looks vulnerable or isolated from the group.
> 
>> [!important|c-red]+ **Fighting the Night Hunter**
>> - The Night Hunter fights to the death, its game finally over.
>> - It remains in the shadows at first and then leaps out into full view, unleashing a **triumphant, unholy scream**. All PCs who hear the scream must pass a **DC 15 Wisdom save** or be **paralyzed in fear until the end of their next turn**.
>> - The Night Hunter carries a cursed butcher's blade called the **Night Hunter's Knife**.
