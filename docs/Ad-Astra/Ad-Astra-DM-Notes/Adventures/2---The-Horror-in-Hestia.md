title: 2 - The Horror in Hestia
---

# Introduction

This is an adaptation of the adventure "Crypts of Azarumme" by the Arcane Library/Kelsey Dionne. It revises that material for a better fit with the history of my homebrew world Ermis, and the incorporation of Cthulhu Mythos elements. 

## Synopsis

- The adventure begins when a Eran seeker contacts the party for help in finding the church's missing Hierophant,  Thanatis Anelisi. 
- While the characters are at the temple, undead creatures erupt into the main chamber, massacre the people present, and retreat with living victims.
- The characters follow the undead down the empty well in the temple's undercroft, leading them to the catacombs beneath.
- Inside the catacombs, the characters find clues about the fate of Thanatis Anelisi. 
- The adventure culminates in a battle against the fallen Anelisi  and the horde of undead she controls with the *Ritus Cranii Vitae Mortis* ("The skull ritual of life and death") from out of the book *[[../Items/Fragmenta-Occultae-Doctrinae-Eran|Fragmenta Occultae Doctrinae Eran]]*, which is a transcribed set of fragments from various other texts both known and unknown. 

## Background

- A few months before the adventure begins, Thanatis discovered an ancient set of catacombs under the temple.
- The catacombs belong to a centuries-gone sect of clerics and warlords who practiced necromantic magic.
- Thanatis began secretly exploring the catacombs after researching the *Fragmenta Occultae*. The book slowly corrupted her mind. With the book's aid he discovered in the catacombs the *Ritus Cranii Vitae Mortis* -- a scroll detailing the Great Old Ones and various necromantic rites and rituals.
- Thanatis is now under the sway of the Codex and has begun animating the bodies interred in the catacombs.
- The adventure begins when Thanatis takes her next step — capturing living victims to use their blood for the rituals the *Ritus Cranii* demands…

# A Missing Hierophant

The PCs have arrived in Hestia, and are recuperating from the trek through the Dunwold. While staying in the city they are contacted by seekers from the temple of Er, who are concerned about the dissapearance of their guide (Hierophantes Thanatis Anelisi). 

Tabath Thrymydd reaches out to the characters by messenger (Valen). She implores them, in the name of Er, to help find the missing Father Reginald Baird. Hierophant Anelisi disappeared three days ago, and the temple will reward each character 100 gp and a boon of healing or aid if they will help find the priest. Tabath invites the group to the church to discuss the matter in greater detail.

# They Came From Below

- Eight young seekers scurry around the main hall preparing for the evening's meeting.
- Tabath Thrymydd greets the characters near the door. She sizes them up in conversation.
- If Tabath trusts the characters, she pulls them aside in the main hall and explains her theory that Guide Thanatis went missing down the well in the church's undercroft (crypt).

![[../../../assets/img/npc-tabath.png|hsmall right]]

> [!person] Tabath Thrymydd, LG [[../../../../haemin-ermis|haemin]] [[../../../../acolyte|acolyte]] 
> "In times of hardship, Er provides strength to those steadfast in contemplation. Your arrival must be the will of the Divine Unity."
> - *Appearance*. Slightly stout, short; lightly rumpled robes and an oversized tabard of Er that's a bit too long. 
> - *Does*. Clucks her tongue at the younger acolytes and directs them with authority.
> - *Secret*. Much less confident than she seems — on the verge of panic at running the temple without Thanatis Anelisi. 

## Development

- During the discussion with Tabath, any character whose passive *Wisdom (Perception)* score is **13 or higher** hears a distant crash back inside the church's chambers.
- Two rounds later, four ghasts and six ghouls with glowing, green eyes smash into the main hall from the interior rooms.

> [!important] Dramatic Question
> Can the group survive the massacre and protect the acolytes?

## Combat

- The undead mob is here to collect four victims for Anelisi to sacrifice according to the rites of the *Ritus Cranii Vitae Mortis*. They capture up to four seekers over the course of three rounds before retreating with their victims.
- The preternaturally intelligent ghouls use their overwhelming numbers to paralyze acolytes (use the commoner stat block) and drag them to the well in the undercroft.
- The ghasts stay behind to block passage to the undercroft until their brethren have escaped with the victims.

## Treasure

The undead have shards of emerald embedded in their eyes. The shards glow with green flame while embedded in an animate undead's eyes, but the glow fades five minutes after a shard is removed from its host. Each is worth 10 gp.

## Transition

Use one of the adventure hooks in A Missing Priest if the characters are not already invested in searching for Guide Anelisi. Move to *Down The Well* when the group goes down the dry, crumbling well in the undercroft.

# Down The Well

> [!info] Sidebar: Inside the Catacombs
> ![[../../../assets/img/catacombs-keyed.png|hmedium left]]
> - The catacombs are redolent with necromantic energy. The halls reek of decay and stale air, and darkness permeates.
> - Thousands of bones are packed together to form grisly walls and ceilings.
> - For each hour the PCs spend here, each must make a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw**. Upon failure, he or she is afflicted with an effect from the *Corrupt the living* table (Appendix C). The effects last for 24 hours.
>
> 


## Area 1: The Bottom Of The Well

![[../../../assets/img/hestia-catacombs-1.png|ws-med right]]

- The well goes down 40 feet to a circular, crumbling chamber.
- Two tunnels of unworked stone extend in opposite directions from the chamber. Water sloshes somewhere in the distance.
- A tightly closed stone door sits opposite the tunnels. Two hands holding **a deep bowl** form the handles. The door has no obvious lock.

#### Development

- The door bears a faded inscription carved in some forgotten tongue (Aklo) that says, "Pay now the toll of the living lest ye enter the domain of the dead too rich in life."
- A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals traces of magic in the bowl.
- Characters can smash the door open with a DC 23 Strength check. The door glides open if the bowl is filled with 1d10 hit points' worth of fresh blood.

## Area 2: Halls Of Bone

- Alcoves line the walls of a hall extending into a large, open chamber. A skeleton is lashed into a standing position in each alcove. They clutch rosaries of human teeth.
- A hooded statue looms over an altar at the end of the chamber. Its hands reach down to a shallow bowl that flickers with green fire.

#### Development

- Tarry blood congeals in the glowing bowl on the altar. If a character places an inert emerald shard into the bowl, the shard glows and energizes for five minutes.
- Inspecting the skeleton in the second alcove reveals shallow gouges in its eye sockets. If a character jams an energized emerald shard into the socket, the skeleton jerks to life with a scream and pushes the secret door behind it open. It is restrained, weaponless, and won't fight.

![[../../../assets/img/hestia-catacombs-2-3.png|hmed right]]

## Area 3: Altar Of The Skull

- The walls and ceiling are decorated with hundreds of leering skulls.
- A rune-carved altar with an empty, shallow divot in the center dominates the chamber.
- A torn, bloody seeker's tunic lies on the floor.

#### Development

- Touching the altar imparts an unpleasant, temporary numbness.
- The inscription on the altar is in Abyssal: "Feed life to the skull, and it shall give ye death to wield against the enemies of the Opener."
- Characters proficient in Intelligence (Religion) know the Opener is a storied (mythical) being, and that there are still groups that worship it. 
- Characters with a passive Intelligence (History) check of 15 or higher know that the Opener is sometimes associated with connecting the living and the dead, which may perhaps explain all of the necromantic trappings. 

### Treasure

Tangled in the seeker's tunic is a silver holy symbol of Er worth 50 gp. A good aligned creature who wears it has advantage on one Wisdom ability check per day.

## Transition

Go to *Into the Catacombs* if the characters move to the tunnels in Area 1.

# Into The Catacombs

> [!info] Sidebar: Unstable Ground
> - Sinkholes lurk along the floors of the catacombs. These pits are 30 feet deep. For each round a creature stands in a square adjacent to a pit, there's a 25% chance the square will collapse into a new 5-foot wide, 30-foot deep pit (maximum two per pit).
> - Characters may avoid falling into a pit with a **DC 15 Dexterity** saving throw.

## Area 4: Underground Spring

- The halls stacked with skeletal remains widen into a broad, echoing cavern.
- A still pool of sulfurous water simmers at the back of the cavern. Several limp bodies in white tabards float in it. Blood drifts from their wrists in thin ribbons.

![[../../../assets/img/hestia-catacombs-4.png|left hmed]]

#### Spare These Mortals

- Thanatis Anelisi had his minions toss the blood-drained bodies of the captured acolytes here.
- Two of the acolytes (treat them as commoners), human female **Mariel** and male haemin **Naugrem**, are still clinging to life. They are both on their final death saving throw.
- Roll initiative to keep track of time by the round as the characters react.

> [!important] DRAMATIC QUESTION
> Can the characters save the living acolytes?

#### Development

- If revived, the acolytes speak with chattering teeth about the hooded sorcerer who slit their wrists and filled bowls with their blood. Then, the undead beasts dragged them here.
- The sorcerer wore a black robe, had a raspy voice, and his nails were falling out. His eyes glowed with the same green as the undead.

## Area 5: Collapsed Mausoleum

![[../../../assets/img/hestia-catacombs-5.png|hs-med right]]

- A pit in the corner of this cavern houses a gibbering, wounded ghoul that has fallen in and can't escape. Its eyes burn with green fire. It tries to climb by bracing itself against the sides, showing unusual intelligence, but its wounds keep it from progressing.
- A ruptured mausoleum sits half-open in the collapsing wall. The narrow, stone coffins inside have all recently been torn open.



### Treasure

![[../../../assets/img/rings-icon-B&W.png|htiny left]]

A dusty cache of 150 gold pieces stamped with the forgotten symbol of the Opener lies piled at the back of the mausoleum. A vial containing what looks like bubbling and churning mist [[../../../../potion-of-gaseous-form|Potion of Gaseous Form]] sits among the coins.

### Transition

Go to Down The Well if the characters return to the well in Area 1, or Crypt of the Fallen if they take the tunnel to Area 4.

# Crypt Of The Fallen

![[../../../assets/img/hestia-catacombs-6.png|hmed right]]

## Area 6: Glowing Cavern

- A hooded sorcerer stands over a guttering brazier boiling with green fire.
- Four swaying ghouls stare in thrall at the emerald-eyed skull inside brazier. Piercing whispers emanate from it in a vile language.
- Shattered mausoleums loom around the edges of the cavern. Green flashes reflect inside the tombs like cat eyes.
- Four statues encircle the brazier. Blood spills from the full bowls in their hands, tracing lines to the sputtering brazier.
- Sinkholes dot the uneven floor.

#### Development

- The sorcerer, who is Thanatis Anelisi, hears the characters coming if they don't make an effort to be stealthy. He prepares by summoning three green-eyed skeletons.
- Thanatis Anelisi takes sick delight in revealing that he is the priest the group seeks.
- If the characters show any aggression, Thanatis Anelisi snaps his rotting fingers and the ghouls spring to attention. Go to the Combat section.

![[../../../assets/img/npc-thanatis.webp|hsmall left]]

> [!person] Thanatis Anelisi, LE human 
> "The Keeper of the Gate orders you to abandon this dark place, my children. Leave us to rot. Come now, will you defy our saint's holy commands?"
> 
> - *Appearance*. Short. Thin beard and delicate features. Nails blackened and dying. Eyes burning with green marsh-light.
> - *Does*. Smiles twitchily and admonishes the group to heed the Keeper of the Gate's "commands."
> - *Secret*. Feared the growing power and divine favor Tabath was showing.

> [!info] Sidebar: The Runeskull
> ![[../../../assets/img/runeskull.png|hsmall left]]
> - The Runeskull is used to raise undead armies. A burning emerald glows in the cyclopean skull's lone eye socket. It is covered in the glyphs and sigils described in the *Fragmenta Arcanum*. Fell secrets leech from its hollows in an echoing whisper.
> - While the Runeskull does not have specific game statistics, the scope and nature of its abilities can be defined by the GM. For the purposes of this adventure, it grants its bonded wielder lair actions and the power to animate unusually intelligent undead.
> - The Runeskull has an AC of 14 and 30 hit points. Its effects end if destroyed.

> [!FAQ] Dramatic Question
> Can the characters defeat Thanatis Anelisi?

### Combat

- Thanatis Anelisi uses his lair action to summon three skeletons. He casts spirit guardians on his first turn, staying out of melee range and in cover as long as possible.
- The four ghouls grapple characters who get close to Thanatis Anelisi and drag them along for a shared fall down the sinkholes.
- Thanatis Anelisi panics if anyone attacks the Runeskull. He focuses guiding bolts on those individuals.

### Treasure

The emerald inside the Runeskull is worth 200 gp (it becomes mundane if the Runeskull is destroyed).

### Transition

Go to Down The Well if the characters return to Area 1, or Twisting Catacombs if they take the tunnels to Areas 4 and 5. If the characters have defeated Thanatis Anelisi, they can move on to the Aftermath section.

# Aftermath

### Who Will Run The Temple?

- Without Thanatis Anelisi, the temple of Er is without concrete leadership. If Tabath is alive, she volunteers to be the interim Guide, but her training isn't complete. The characters may devise a plan to help with this situation.
- Tabath or another member of the church makes sure the characters are paid 100 gp each for their help in the catacombs. The seekers/guides will also fulfill a boon for each character (within reason).

### The Runeskull

- Characters who want to use the Runeskull instead of destroy it may make gains in the short term, but the skull's ill effects are inescapable in the long term. In this situation, the GM is encouraged to create specific positive and negative effects for the Runeskull. If the characters use it, they draw the attention of more powerful parties, both good and evil.

### Future Adventure Hooks

- The group may decide to seek out further information or treasures from the followers of the Opener. 
- Tabath may ask the party to deliver the news about Thanatis Anelisi to the elders of the Eran fellowship, requiring travel through dangerous territory.
- The characters may be called upon to help find a new Hierophant to lead the temple of Er, or to lead it themselves during the search for a new Hierophant.
- The Runeskull in this crypt may not have been the only one left in the world…
