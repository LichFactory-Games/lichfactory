# Campaign Fronts

Let's use the concept of a [front](https://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/gamemastering#TOC-Fronts) (see also [Sly Flourish on Fronts](https://slyflourish.com/fronts_in_dnd.html)) to flesh out the campaign world. 

Fronts consist of a set of *dangers*, each one representing a faction or a challenge tied to the front. Dangers include many components you might be used to such as a band of orcs, a thieves' guild, or a necromancer summoning a powerful beast. These dangers contain the following components that bring them to life:

- **The Impulse**: The motivation that drives this collection of villainy forward.
- **Grim Portents**: The steps this threat follows when unchecked by the PCs.
- **The Impending Doom**: The conclusion should this threat not be stopped or thwarted.

In the case of Erspace there are various types of dangers, including: 

- Eldritch forces (Yog-Sothoth, Cthulhlu)
- Factions (The Haim, The Fair, The Dyarchy, The Great Houses)
- Arcane Enemies (The A'lhruhyn, The Cult of Hodos)

Let's detail the main aspects of three central fronts for the first part of the campaign. 

## The Alhoon

The [[../NPCs/Ermis-BBEG|A'lhruhyn]] -- Â U'xulex, C'thaxis, and Qua'alon are scheming to finally escape Erspace, in which they have been trapped for a millennium. They have discovered that a series of crucial artifacts are on Ermis. They have been slowly manipulating the populace of Astryth (via an intellect devourer) to achieve their goals. 

- **Lieutenant**: Sereb, an [[../../../../intellect-devourer|Intellect Devourer]] 
- **Henchmen**: Cultists (unwittingly), various adventurer or mercenary types (also unwittingly), the Sil. 
- **Impending Doom**: The Triumvirate acquire all the artifacts necessary to open a gate to Yog-Sothoth, and utilize some of his power to escape Erspace. Yog-Sothoth's unchecked entry into Erspace would lead to the destruction of all life in the system.
- **Grim Portent**: Strange abberations are unleashed upon the city and surrounding countryside of Astryth. 
- **Grim Portent**: The gate between Ermis and the Outer Disk is opened. 
- **Grim Portent**:  Sereb becomes leader of the CoH. 


## The Cult of Hodos (The Opener of The Way)

The [[../Erspace-Almanac/Ermis/Factions-&-Fellowships/Cult-of-the-Opener-of-the-Way|Followers of Hodos]] is a fringe religion that worships the mysterious "opener of the way". They preach the "way", which is at once spiritual, lifestyle, and literal, as in the "way out" of Ermis. The cult seems crazed to outsiders, who can make no sense of a "way out" of Ermis. What could be "outside" Ermis? Ermis is all that there is, it is the manifestation of Er in his splendor and completeness. 

FoH preaches a different view -- that Ermis is just a place, and not all of reality, and that there are other places in existence, which the Opener of the Way can take the willing, if only they can see. 

- **Lieutenant**: Zerrenia, a [[../../../../wizard-orimancer-ermis|Orimancer]] of great power. 
- **Henchmen**: members of the cult. 
- **Impending Doom**: The gate is successfully opened, though Zerrenia thinks she is opening a gate for the Opener, she is really opening a teleport gate for the Triumvirate. 
- **Grim Portent**: The CoH has been attacking temples of Er 
- **Grim Portent**: There are thefts of several magical artifacts or components related to the manipulation of space. 
- **Grim Portent**: The Astronomicon is taken from House Tethys. 
- **Grim Portent**: A component of the Orrery of Anakleidos is taken from the Haim Collective. 

## The Dyarchy

[[../Erspace-Almanac/Ermis/Factions-&-Fellowships/The-Dyarchy|The Dyarchy]] has evolved from its roots as a means of keeping peace between the great houses, into a fascist theocracy bent on bringing order to all of Ermis. The creeping fascism of the Dyarchy has started to sow dissent amongst the Great Houses, not all of whom are willing to live under the putatively "rational order" of the Dyarchy as the expression of Er, the one god. 

- **Lieutenant**: Eryn Kell (Eldritch Knight & Head of the Watch)
- **Henchmen**: The Hetai (Warriors), the Erathoi (Clerics/Prieshood), the Gnostari (Psions)
- **Impending Doom**: Total Hegemony
- **Grim Portent**: People are being swept up by City Watch and jailed for no obvious reason 
- **Grim Portent**: Senior members of the Great Houses are disappearing
- **Grim Portent**: The Dyad has built a flying war machine
