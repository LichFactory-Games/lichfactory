Here are some conventions for naming characters and places in Erspace, and specifically on Ermis.

- [[../../../../haemin-ermis|Haemin]]: Welsh 
- [[../../../../the-faeir-ermis|The Faeir]]: Mix of British and Romani naming conventions 
- [[../../../../doloi-ermis|Doloi]]: Liberal use of 'Xs' and other sharp or difficult to pronounce words -- perhaps a strong persian influence? 
- [[../Erspace-Almanac/Ermis/Factions-&-Fellowships/The-Dyarchy|The Dyarchy]]: Ancient Greek, British, and Macedonian influences; lots of 'Os', 'Ks', 'Rs', and 'Xs'. 
- [[../Erspace-Almanac/Ermis/Creatures-&-Curiosities/Sil|Sil]]: lots of 'Zs' and 'Ss'.
