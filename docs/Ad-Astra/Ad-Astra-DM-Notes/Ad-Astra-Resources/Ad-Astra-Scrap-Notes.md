# Potential Situations

- Strange events occurring in Astryth - Sets the stage with mystery and foreboding
- Zerrenia contacts the PCs then disappears - Inciting incident to draw PCs in
- Karenikos holding sermons - Foreshadowing, clues he is deceiving people 
- Gar kidnapped, leads to sewers - Introduces monster experiments and clues
- Thieves' guild hideout - Reveals occult artifact interests, kidnapping
- Interactions with House Tethys - Gain access to Astranomicon book 
- Researching the Astranomicon - PCs learn of Via Astra pieces across worlds
- Seres' experiments and creatures - Provides combat challenges and enemies
- Pursuing Alhoon into wildspace - Expands scope, spelljamming elements
- Finding Via Astra pieces - Creates investigative challenges and exploration
- Stopping the Alhoon ritual - Climactic confrontation to stop Yog-Sothoth  

The connections follow a general pattern:

- Mystery > Inciting Incident > Investigation > Confrontation > Expanded Scope

The situations build on each other to create a progression from local mystery to cosmic threat. The sewers, thieves' guild, and House Tethys lead into the Astranomicon, which then expands into the wildspace pursuit of the Alhoon.

Here are some ideas for connecting Zerrenia's disappearance to Karenikos and Gar's kidnapping:

- Zerrenia was investigating Karenikos' sermons and occult interests. She learned too much and Karenikos had her captured to keep her silent.
- Zerrenia caught wind of rumors of experiments and disappearances (like Gar's). She intended to warn the authorities but was silenced first. 
- In her studies, Zerrenia decoded passages in the Astranomicon about the Via Astra. Karenikos wants this knowledge and had her taken.
- Gar learned of Zerrenia's occult expertise. He went to warn her that Karenikos was seeking dark magic. But both disappeared.
- The monster that took Gar was summoned by Karenikos. Zerrenia knew this and wanted to track down its source before she too vanished.
- Zerrenia learned that Karenikos' rituals required occult artifacts. The thieves' guild is helping locate artifacts for Karenikos. 
- Karenikos orchestrated Zerrenia's disappearance to spur the PCs into action, intending to manipulate them for his own ends.

The core ideas are that Zerrenia learned too much about Karenikos/the occult threat and also that she may have known one or more of the other key NPCs related to the disappearances and experiments. Her knowledge made her a target.
