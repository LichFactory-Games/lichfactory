  - Characters need to level up
  - Foundry Issues: 
    - How to manually add someone to initiative order? 
    - What to do with Val wanting to roll physical dice rather than use foundry? 
    - Using creature tokens, it was often hard to see what to do -- perhaps I shouldn't have them use token vision? 
  	  - Using LessFog mod might resolve this 
  - I thought the TotM scenes worked well, though I suppose I was a bit disappointed that no one commented on the visuals. 
  - The sound effects ended up being more useful than I would have originally thought. I think it is best that I have them on a soundboard rather than using them from the sidebar.

## Characters

| Art | PC | Quick Stats | Ancestry | BG | Class | Proficiencies | Languages |
| --- | -- | ----------- | -------- | -- | ----- | ------------- | --------- |


## TODO
- [x] Contingency plan for the Night Hunter 
- [x] Revamp sequence of escalations 
- [x] Distribute secrets & rumors to players

## Background

After finishing session 0 we find the PCs stopping to camp for the evening in the middle of the Dunwold, on their way north to Astryth. 

## Strong Start

> [!recite]
> After a long day's travel you stop to make camp for the night. Though it is early spring, snowflakes begin to fill the air and soon a gentle blanket of snow covers the wood. Beyond the crackling of the fire you hear only the wind and occasional sounds of animals making their way through the forest. 
> Celin, returning from foraging for food has an uneasy look about him -- he looks at you all and says "There is something not right about the wold."

# Scenes
> [!columns|2 no-t]
> > [!warning|no-i c-gray]+ **The Howling**
> > - READ: *A keening howl rises on the wind from the surrounding forest.*
> > - Characters can tell the howl isn't a wolf, coyote, or other common forest creature. The character with the highest Wisdom score notices it sounds like a creature with a speaking voice â€” perhaps an intelligent being.
> > - Characters trying to rest won't be able to unless they pass a DC 15 Constitution check. 
> > - The howl draws closer over the next hour. As soon as it's within 100 feet of the camp, it abruptly stops.
>
> > [!investigate|no-i]+ **Rumors & An Owl**
> > - READ: *A crack and hiss echoes from the trees above camp just outside the reach of the campfire light.* Investigation reveals some broken branches and the spectacle of a great horned owl snapping the spine of a rabbit it just caught.
> > - Distribute [[Ad-Astra-Session-1#Secret and Clues|Secret and Clues]] randomly to the players around the fire 
> > - After the owl incident, a quiet hour passes. Then, it strikes 
 
> [!important|c-red]+ **It Strikes**
> - READ: *The silence breaks as a dozen thundering footfalls crash toward camp.*
> - The footfalls are a herd of six elk the Night Hunter spooked in the direction of the PCs' camp. They reach the camp in one round.
> > READ: *Two of the elk have deep, straight cuts bleeding down their necks and flanks. They're wild with fear.* 
> - PCs can calm individual elk with DC 18 Animal Handling checks (DC 20 for the two wounded ones).
> - While the PCs are distracted by the elk, the Night Hunter targets the character nearest the edge of the woods. It grapples it and drags it out into the woods, attempting to subdue it silently. The default character to be taken is [[../NPCs/Celin-Lothvari-(NPC)|Celin Lothvari (NPC)]].
> - PCs watching the pack animals can pass a DC 15 Perception check to notice the flash of a blade from the darkness, followed by the character slumping over. The **Night Hunter flees** if noticed. The slain animal leaves a bloody trail 60 feet out into the darkness, ending with its body. If the PCs don't have a pack animal, the Night Hunter carves a conspicuous series of X marks into a line of trees leading out 60 feet from camp. The trail ends with the body of an elk with its throat cut.
> - The elk spend 1d4 rounds wheeling around the campsite. They charge anyone who gets in their way or fails an Animal Handling check.
> - After the PCs regroup in camp, another quiet hour passes. The insects and birds have fallen utterly silent. The Night Hunter hides 100 feet from camp. 

> [!columns|2 no-t]
> > [!place|no-i c-yellow]+ **A Cry for Help**
> > - READ: *A terrified scream rips through the night. The voice is frantic and shrill, and it calls out for help in Common.*
> > - The Night Hunter is mimicking the voice of a person, trying to draw goodhearted PCs into the darkness.  If any PCs investigate, the Night Hunter attacks from hiding. Go to Combat. 
> > - Otherwise, the PCs listen on as the Night Hunter imitates the sounds of finding and disemboweling its victim. Any PCs hearing it must pass a **DC 15 Wisdom save** or suffer one form of [[../../../../short-term-madness|Short-Term Madness]]. Attempting to sleep through these sounds is impossible without a way to fully block the listeners' ears.
>
>> [!important|c-purple]+ **Combat w/The Night Hunter**
> > - The Night Hunter keeps to the fringes of combat and light, never fully revealing itself.
> > - It tries to knock one PC unconscious and drag that character off into the night to crucify to a tree with wooden stakes. It will return later to disembowel that PC after it finishes hunting the rest of the party. 
> > - A PC who returns to consciousness can escape the tree with a **DC 15 Strength check**. They must pass a **DC 15 Constitution** save or take 1d6 piercing damage in the process. 
> > - If the Night Hunter can't gain an upper hand quickly, it slips away into the darkness and hides. The Night Hunter leaves any captured PCs pinned to trees and even allows other PCs to find and rescue them.
> > - Two hours pass.

> [!columns|2 no-t]
> > [!important|c-orange]+ **The Butchery**
>> - READ: *Silence fills the heavy air, pressing in like the boiling clouds overhead. Dim moonlight turns the tops of the towering pine trees silvery white.*
>> - The Night Hunter approaches the camp silently, attacking any PC who looks vulnerable or isolated from the group.
> 
>> [!important|c-red]+ **Fighting the Night Hunter**
>> - The Night Hunter fights to the death, its game finally over.
>> - It remains in the shadows at first and then leaps out into full view, unleashing a **triumphant, unholy scream**. All PCs who hear the scream must pass a **DC 15 Wisdom save** or be **paralyzed in fear until the end of their next turn**.
>> - The Night Hunter carries a cursed butcher's blade called the **Night Hunter's Knife**.



# Secret and Clues

*What ten [secrets and clues](https://slyflourish.com/sharing_secrets.html) might the characters uncover? Secrets might be related to the characters, NPCs, locations, bits of history, or quests. Drop in secrets as appropriate during the game.*

-   [x] An entire logging site turned up empty in these woods a few months back, camp gear strewn everywhere. They never found a single person.
-   [x] They say the old woodlanders used to send one unlucky soul out into the forest when the evil spirits were restless. That person never came back.
-   [x] There's a ghost story about a long-fingered being in the woods called The Willowman that steals children who don't listen to their parents.
-   [x] A few years ago, a dying man stumbled into a village cut open from neck to belly. They never figured out what sort of creature could have done that.
-   [x] A friend said her hunting party came across a body nailed to a tree with wooden spikes. Something had pulled out all of its innards, too.
-   [ ] They say livestock and horses go missing when caught in Dunwold during Strom's Ebb. It's like they just wander off into the darkness and disappear.
-   [ ] Tattered pieces of a map are found hanging from a thorned bush. They reveal the markings of a previous expedition that ventured into the Dunwold but never returned.
-   [ ] While camping under the dense canopy of the Dunwold, you hear soft, melodic whispers in a language you can't quite understand. They seem to come from the trees themselves. (The Dunwold forest is ancient and sentient. These whispers are the forest's way of communicating with those who enter. They might provide warnings, guidance, or cryptic riddles related to the party's journey, including clues about Astryth.)
- [ ] The sea villages along the coast have been visited by strange ships in the last months. 
- [ ] Rumors have reached the south that Astryth has been seeing increased disturbances in the last months. No one knows why. But security is being tightened. 


# Fantastic Locations

*What fantastic locations might the characters explore? Think of these like the backdrop to a scene in a play. You'll generally want one location for every 45 minutes of gameplay you're expecting. Give each location one or more interesting features the characters might interact with. Try some [inspirational monuments](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/monuments.html). Make these new pages if you want to add maps or details.*

-   **Location 1**: [[../../Player's-Almanac/The-Dunwold|The Dunwold]] , an ancient forest in southern Verdoun. 

# NPCs

*What [NPCs](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/npc_generator.html) might the characters interact with? Give them an interesting [name](https://slyflourish.com/random_name_generator.html) and use an archetype from a movie for their mannerisms. Make these new pages if you want to keep track of more information or add pictures.*

- [[../NPCs/Celin-Lothvari-(NPC)|Celin Lothvari (NPC)]] 

# Monsters

*What monsters might the characters face? What type and quantity of monsters make sense for the situation? Calculate the "[deadly benchmark](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_encounter_benchmark.html)". The encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster Challenge Ratings are greater than one quarter of the sum total of character levels or half if they're above 4th level.*

- 6-8 Elk (CR 1/4)
- The Night Hunter (CR 2)
- Shadow Spinters (custom shadow monsters)

## Hazards

- After the first hour all movement outside a 10 foot radius of the fire becomes [[Difficult Terrain|Difficult Terrain]] (i.e. 1/2 movement)

# Treasure

*Choose some interesting [treasure](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/5e_treasure.html) and maybe a handful of [relics](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/relics.html).*

- The Night Hunter's Knife (Cursed Butcher Knife)
- 3 gp 
- 13 silver 
- 20 copper distributed among the other bodies found crucified to trees 
- [[../../../../clothes-of-mending-xge|clothes-of-mending-xge]] 
- [[../../../../boots-of-false-tracks-xge|boots-of-false-tracks-xge]] 
- [[../../../../bead-of-nourishment-xge|bead-of-nourishment-xge]] 
- 1 [[../../../../potion-of-healing|Potion of Healing]] 


## Session Recap

Session went pretty well. 

I'd say that as written adventure is pretty good. Had a little trouble getting the party to share rumors. Perhaps I should have just started them sitting around the campfire, as they seemed a bit perplexed initially as to what they should be doing as they stopped to make camp for the night. But I also chalk this up to first session jitters. 

I have a hard time seeing how the adventure would only take two hours unless you really did just start with them around the fire and fairly quickly move through the howling and the owl incident to the elk. In our case the elk encounter took nearly a whole hour itself, though it also had some great moments, including Val's character Ryalith jumping on an Elk and riding it out of the campsite and Griffin's Stigs climbing up a tree in fear of his life (as an anxious 'city slicker' caught in the woods) 

Because the Elk encounter took so long I didn't really use the whole "animal is killed and dragged out for sport" thing, except as a means of  further splitting the group once they had decided to split up and explore the forest (LOL!). It worked out well because that left only two characters alone and the Night Hunter immediately jumped out and attacked and nearly killed Stigs. However, from then on the PCs had the upper hand. The pugilists are quite tough, and did a lot of damage without taking any. Gloopwing didn't even really get in the battle (? I found Rebbecca's tactics here very questionable, but fortunately she is not the main/only skirmisher -- but she's too cautious for a fighter, if hilariously so). 

The shadow splinters were a great idea (if I do say so myself) and they served their purpose of drawing fire. But in the midst of battle I just generated one per hit rather than rolling, and as it was they didn't succeed in their attacks. Plus Val/Ryalith was smart enough to say that the party should focus its attacks on the Night Hunter and ignore the shadows. This was really the move that saved them. Well that and the crit that Karel made in punching right through the Night Hunter. Very cinematic. 

Celin also was comically bad throughout the adventure -- he failed basically every ability check or attack roll he made. But this really made things all the better. 

Everyone seemed to have had a lot of fun though -- and I certainly enjoyed myself.
