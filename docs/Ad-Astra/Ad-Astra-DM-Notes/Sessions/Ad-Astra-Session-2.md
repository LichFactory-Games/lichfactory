## Background

The PCs have made it through [[../../Player's-Almanac/The-Dunwold|The Dunwold]] and are now recovering in [[../../Player's-Almanac/Hestia|Hestia]], on the other side of the wold. Hestia is a medium-sized town, that focuses on trade, timber, and farming. It is one of the main stops to and from the coast through the Dunwold. 

## Strong Start

>[!recite]
> The past few nights at the Crooked Tree Inn have been restless for you all, haunted by vivid nightmares of dark rituals and flaming green skulls. You see a robed figure chanting before a cyclopean skull wreathed in eldritch flames. Faceless acolytes drag shrieking victims into the shadows as whispering chants fill your mind. But this last night seemed the worst. The inn's simple wooden walls feel more suffocating than comforting when you wake in a cold sweat.
>
> As you head downstairs, you see a young seeker (named Valen Karnakis) from the Temple of Er posting notices asking for help. He looks anxious and weary as he appeals to the few patrons eating breakfast. When he spots your group, a flash of hope crosses his face and he comes over to speak with you. 

Valen introduces himself and quickly explains that Hierophant Anelisi has gone missing. The temple elders are desperate for any heroes who can aid the search. All the characters have the feeling that their nightmares are connected to the Hierophant's disappearance. The image of that flaming emerald skull still seems seared into your minds.

> [!FAQ]- Possibilities 
> If the players decline the request here are some options: 
> - After they refuse, the characters see seekers from the temple posting bounties and frantically gathering volunteers. Guilt nags at them as the search continues without their aid.
> - Tabath Thrymydd herself approaches the characters and tries to persuade them, leveraging their reputation as heroes or appealing to their faith. If they still decline, she warns darkly of ominous omens and broken spirits.
> - Undead attacks occur around town by arcane forces unleashed in the Hierophant's absence. The characters are forced to help against the rising darkness.

## Secret and Clues

*What ten [secrets and clues](https://slyflourish.com/sharing_secrets.html) might the characters uncover? Secrets might be related to the characters, NPCs, locations, bits of history, or quests. Drop in secrets as appropriate during the game.*

- [ ] The sea villages along the coast have been visited by strange ships in the last months. They have been bringing strange materials through the Dunwold. 
- [ ] Rumors have reached the south that Astryth has been seeing increased disturbances in the last months. No one knows why. But security is being tightened. 
- [X] House Tethys has had an unusual amount of shipping activity in the last few months. Someone is importing lots of goods and strange packages. 
- [X] Thanatis Anelisi discovered the catacombs under the temple a few months ago and became corrupted in their research of the history of the catacombs and the rituals practiced therein 
- [ ] Thanatis is performing blood rituals as instructed in the *Fragmenta Arcana* to raise an undead army.
- [ ] The emerald shards in the undead's eyes seem connected to the Runeskull's powers. Perhaps destroying it could stop the undead.
- [ ] According to legend, the "Opener" mentioned on the altar inscription is a mythical god-like being associated with undeath, travel, and knowledge. Thanatis seems to worship it.
- [ ] The acolytes mention Thanatis's rotting body. The Runeskull may be decaying him from within.
- [ ] Disturbing dreams and visions afflict those who stay too long in the catacombs, corrupting them over time.
- [X] Tabath knows more than she lets on about Thanatis's interest in the catacombs and the Runeskull.
- [ ] The *Fragmenta Arcana* describes various unholy rituals. It promises long life (undeath), knowledge, and power.
- [ ] Before his fall, Thanatis had been in contact with scholars in Astryth researching the Opener.
- [ ] Rumors and whispers in/from Astryth connect the Opener cult to secretive groups operating in the undercity and underdark below the city.

## Fantastic Locations

*What fantastic locations might the characters explore? Think of these like the backdrop to a scene in a play. You'll generally want one location for every 45 minutes of gameplay you're expecting. Give each location one or more interesting features the characters might interact with. Try some [inspirational monuments](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/monuments.html). Make these new pages if you want to add maps or details.*

- **Hestia**: Large town, crossroads for travellers headed to and from Astryth
- **Temple of Er** - Desecrated temple, scene of undead massacre. Holds clues that Thanatis went below. Access to the catacomb entrance.
	- Simple marble columns rise up to support a curved dome ceiling painted with the arcing light of the Strom. 
	- An altar of carved basalt sits on a dais at the far end, bloodstains now (i.e. after the massecre) splashed across its surface. Shredded holy books and broken pews litter the sanctuary after the undead attack.
	- Beneath the altar, a narrow stairwell descends into musty darkness. Flickering torchlight reveals a burial shroud discarded on the steps.
- **Catacombs** - Ancient crypts below temple, used for dark rituals by Thanatis. Dangerous traps and undead. Leads to Thanatis's lair.
	- The crumbling halls are choked with cobwebs and lined with alcoves holding skeletal remains. Each alcove contains a small etching of the contained person's name and birth/death years.
	- Shadowy figures seem to dart through distant doorways whenever the party glances away. Disturbing whispers in some unknown tongue echo along the corridors.
	- Sections of the hall have collapsed into muddy sinkholes filled with bones. Slick trails lead towards gaping crypts where the dead have already awakened.
- **Thanatis's Lair** - Site of blood rituals. Thanatis resides here with the Runeskull. PCs must defeat him here to end the threat.
	- This chamber is ringed by shattered tombs and mausoleums with doors smashed open from the inside.
	- Arcane sigils are scrawled on the floor in what looks disturbingly like dried blood. They emit an eerie green glow pulsing in time with the emerald shard embedded in the Runeskull.
	- Shackled skeletons are huddled around the skull's altar, compelled to chant in unison by unseen powers. The skulls of previous sacrifices are melded grotesquely into the walls in a twisted mosaic.

## NPCs

*What [NPCs](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/npc_generator.html) might the characters interact with? Give them an interesting [name](https://slyflourish.com/random_name_generator.html) and use an archetype from a movie for their mannerisms. Make these new pages if you want to keep track of more information or add pictures.*

## Monsters

*What monsters might the characters face? What type and quantity of monsters make sense for the situation? Calculate the "[deadly benchmark](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_encounter_benchmark.html)". The encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster Challenge Ratings are greater than one quarter of the sum total of character levels or half if they're above 4th level.*

-   **Deadly Encounter Benchmark:**
	- 4 Ghasts & 6 Ghouls 
	- [[../NPCs/Thanatis-Anelisi-(NPC)|Thanatis Anelisi (NPC)]], 4 Ghouls, & 3 Skeletons

## Session Notes

Good session. Pretty much everything developed according to plan. PCs were hanging in the tavern (Gloopwing literally doing so) and were approached by Valen at the behest of Jonas -- who wanted to make sure he gets paid -- to request they join in the search for the missing Hierophant. A little tough to get them to really engage with Valen as an NPC (I played him as a kind of nervous and fast-talky Ted from Bill & Ted fame). It seems like the party is perhaps more motivated by money than by a desire to help, which is totally fine. Looks like Val/Ryalith may be emerging as the face of the party. 

They went to the temple and met Tabath. She explained the predicament and it seemed to the players (I think) that they were getting themselves into a mystery like scenario. They were about to leave the temple to investigate the annex where the missing Hierophant had his office when the ghouls burst into the main hall and started grabbing people. Valen was immediately surrounded (he had gone with Stigs to investigate a noise). Stigs fired a shot of his new magic crossbow/blaster and then got out of the way. After that it was a full knock-down fight. PCs did well even if they didn't exactly show the best tactics. But three acolytes got taken before the PCs could deal with the remaining ghouls. 

Combat seemed to go fairly smoothly even though there were A LOT of combatants. I fudged a fair bit but it was fine. I had to dial HP of the ghouls way down since the PCs only do a moderate amount of damage on a turn -- and they didn't focus their fire all that effectively so the damage tended to be spread out over 3 or four opponents. This will likely be important for the catacombs. The PCs all have very high ACs but they don't hit very hard (yet).
