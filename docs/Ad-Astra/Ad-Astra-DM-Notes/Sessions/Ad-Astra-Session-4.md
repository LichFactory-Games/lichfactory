### Character Hooks

What sort of hooks for the characters might be exploited in this session and subsequent ones in Astryth?

- Gwen: going to see the Arkane in the Citadel at Astryth 
- Stigs: Since Stigs works for house Orosen, presumably he is going to want to find something for them, or pursue the origins of the *Fragmenta*, etc. 
- Gloopwing: No idea?
- Karel: No idea? Perhaps something about whoever experimented on him and his arm 
- Ryalith: Finding something exciting to do

## Background

The PCs have defeated a necromancer who was using occult artifacts. They have discovered occult interests in Astryth that may have had a hand in these events.

Hopefully the PCs aim to search for the source of the Occult Fragment in Astryth. 

## Strong Start

Not sure what to do here. The natural start is the entrance to Astryth. 

1. Interrogate the Corrupted Hierophant 
	1. What was the goal of raising the undead?
	2. What is the book/where does it come from/who did you get it from? 

2. Entering Astryth. All travellers along the Magna Platea are herded into a line by guards and briefly questioned and scanned by [[../../../../psion-inquisitor-ermis|inquisitors]] of [[../Erspace-Almanac/Ermis/Factions-&-Fellowships/The-Gnostari|The Gnostari]]. 
3. The PCs investigate the origin of the [[../Items/Fragmenta-Occultae|Fragmenta Occultae]].
4. The PCs see a kidnapping occur near the bazaar in Astryth. They can intervene and fight the kidnappers, leading to the thieves' guild hideout.
5. [[../NPCs/Zerrenia-Azhar-(NPC)|Zerrenia Azhar (NPC)]] contacts the PCs (must establish a reasonable basis for why she would know of them). 
    - Zerrenia approaches the PCs in a panic, says she urgently needs help
    - Before explaining more, she looks around nervously, says she's being watched
    - She presses a cryptic note into their hands, telling them to find her at a location
    - When PCs arrive at the location, there are signs of a struggle but Zerrenia is gone
    - They find clues implying she was taken by forces unknown
    - The note contains some arcane symbols or writings hinting at occult forces
    - PCs must now investigate Zerrenia's disappearance and the occult interests in the city

## Scenes

1. Interrogation 
2. Travel to Astryth (maybe encounter some NPCs)
3. Entrance to Astryth (run in with the Dyarchy? Or runin with the 5 knives?)
4. Gala/Auction at [[../Erspace-Almanac/Ermis/Factions-&-Fellowships/House-Tethys|House Tethys]]  
	1. Talk to occult scholar. 
	2. See a bunch of (fake?) artifacts 
	3. Rob the crypt of the astranomicon. 
	4. Speak with the dead/steal/destroy the ossuary 
5. Maybe visit university
