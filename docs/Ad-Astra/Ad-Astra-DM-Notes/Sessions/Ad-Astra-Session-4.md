### Character Hooks

What sort of hooks for the characters might be exploited in this session and subsequent ones in Astryth?

- Gwen: going to see the Arkane in the Citadel at Astryth 
- Stigs: Since Stigs works for house Orosen, presumably he is going to want to find something for them, or pursue the origins of the *Fragmenta*, etc. 
- Gloopwing: Museum of natural history; research Draconic at the University
- Karel: No idea? Perhaps something about whoever experimented on him and his arm 
- Ryalith: Find something exciting to do -- i.e. get into trouble

## Background

The PCs have defeated a necromancer who was using occult artifacts. They have discovered occult interests in Astryth that may have had a hand in these events.

Hopefully the PCs aim to search for the source of the Occult Fragment in Astryth. 

## Strong Start


> [!recite] Read Aloud
> Before you sits, bound and gagged, the Hierophant Anelisi. Since his defeat and the destruction of the Runeskull, his demeanor has changed, his eyes seem wild and staring, no longer filled with a kind of certainty of purpose. His skin retains its extreme pallor, and it is unclear whether his creeping necrosis can be reversed. 
> You spared his life in the final moments of combat. You have recovered an arkane book from his robes, and have called Seeker Tabath to witness his interrogation. What do you do now? 





1. The PCs see a kidnapping occur near the bazaar in Astryth. They can intervene and fight the kidnappers, leading to the thieves' guild hideout.
