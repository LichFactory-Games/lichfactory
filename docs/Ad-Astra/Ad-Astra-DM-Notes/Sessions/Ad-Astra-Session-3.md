## Background

The PCs agreed to help the temple of Er find its guide -- Hierophant Anelisi. In return they would each recieve 100 GP and a boon from the temple. They helped defend the temple against the ghoul attack and will descend into the dark to find the other kidnapped acolytes, as well as determine the fate of the Hierophant, who Tabath suspects of unleashing the undead. 

## Strong Start

## Secret and Clues

*What ten [secrets and clues](https://slyflourish.com/sharing_secrets.html) might the characters uncover? Secrets might be related to the characters, NPCs, locations, bits of history, or quests. Drop in secrets as appropriate during the game.*

- [ ] The sea villages along the coast have been visited by strange ships in the last months. They have been bringing strange materials through the Dunwold. 
- [ ] Rumors have reached the south that Astryth has been seeing increased disturbances in the last months. No one knows why. But security is being tightened. 
- [x] Thanatis is performing blood rituals as instructed in the *Fragmenta Arcana* to raise an undead army.
- [x] The emerald shards in the undead's eyes seem connected to the Runeskull's powers. Perhaps destroying it could stop the undead.
- [ ] According to legend, the "Opener" mentioned on the altar inscription is a mythical god-like being associated with undeath, travel, and knowledge. Thanatis seems to worship it.
- [x] The acolytes mention Thanatis's rotting body. The Runeskull may be decaying him from within.
- [ ] Disturbing dreams and visions afflict those who stay too long in the catacombs, corrupting them over time.
- [ ] The *Fragmenta Arcana* describes various unholy rituals. It promises long life (undeath), knowledge, and power.
- [ ] Before his fall, Thanatis had been in contact with scholars in Astryth researching the Opener.
- [ ] Rumors and whispers in/from Astryth connect the Opener cult to secretive groups operating in the undercity and underdark below the city.

## Fantastic Locations

*What fantastic locations might the characters explore? Think of these like the backdrop to a scene in a play. You'll generally want one location for every 45 minutes of gameplay you're expecting. Give each location one or more interesting features the characters might interact with. Try some [inspirational monuments](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/monuments.html). Make these new pages if you want to add maps or details.*

- **Hestia**: Large town, crossroads for travellers headed to and from Astryth
- **Temple of Er** - Desecrated temple, scene of undead massacre. Holds clues that Thanatis went below. Access to the catacomb entrance.
	- Simple marble columns rise up to support a curved dome ceiling painted with the arcing light of the Strom. 
	- An altar of carved basalt sits on a dais at the far end, bloodstains now (i.e. after the massecre) splashed across its surface. Shredded holy books and broken pews litter the sanctuary after the undead attack.
	- Beneath the altar, a narrow stairwell descends into musty darkness. Flickering torchlight reveals a burial shroud discarded on the steps.
- **Catacombs** - Ancient crypts below temple, used for dark rituals by Thanatis. Dangerous traps and undead. Leads to Thanatis's lair.
	- The crumbling halls are choked with cobwebs and lined with alcoves holding skeletal remains. Each alcove contains a small etching of the contained person's name and birth/death years.
	- Shadowy figures seem to dart through distant doorways whenever the party glances away. Disturbing whispers in some unknown tongue echo along the corridors.
	- Sections of the hall have collapsed into muddy sinkholes filled with bones. Slick trails lead towards gaping crypts where the dead have already awakened.
- **Thanatis's Lair** - Site of blood rituals. Thanatis resides here with the Runeskull. PCs must defeat him here to end the threat.
	- This chamber is ringed by shattered tombs and mausoleums with doors smashed open **from the inside**.
	- Arcane sigils are scrawled on the floor in what looks disturbingly like dried blood. They emit an eerie green glow pulsing in time with the emerald shard embedded in the Runeskull.
	- Shackled skeletons are huddled around the skull's altar, compelled to chant in unison by unseen powers. The skulls of previous sacrifices are melded grotesquely into the walls in a twisted mosaic.

## NPCs

*What [NPCs](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/npc_generator.html) might the characters interact with? Give them an interesting [name](https://slyflourish.com/random_name_generator.html) and use an archetype from a movie for their mannerisms. Make these new pages if you want to keep track of more information or add pictures.* 

>[!columns|4 no-t]
>> [!person] Tabath Thrymydd, LG [[../../../../haemin-ermis|haemin]] [[../../../../acolyte|acolyte]] ![[../../../assets/img/npc-tabath.png|hsmall]]
>> "In times of hardship, Er provides strength to those steadfast in contemplation. Your arrival must be the will of the Divine Unity."
>> - *Appearance*. Lightly rumpled robes and an oversized tabard of Er that's a bit too long.
>> - *Does*. Clucks her tongue at the younger acolytes and directs them with authority.
>> - *Secret*. Much less confident than she seems â€” on the verge of panic at running the church without Thanatis Anelisi. 
>
>> [!person] [[../NPCs/Thanatis-Anelisi-(NPC)|Thanatis Anelisi (NPC)]], LE human ![[../../../assets/img/npc-thanatis.webp|hsmall]]
>> "The Keeper of the Gate orders you to abandon this dark place, my children. Leave us to rot. Come now, will you defy our saint's holy commands?"
>> - *Appearance*. Short. Thin beard and delicate features. Nails blackened and dying. Eyes burning with green marsh-light.
>> - *Does*. Smiles twitchily and admonishes the group to heed the Keeper of the Gate's "commands."
>> - *Secret*. Fears that Hodos will provide no more answers than Er.
>
>> [!person] Valen Karnakis, LG human ![[../../../assets/img/npc-valen.png|hsmall]]
>> "We are all one, man -- we are everything and everything is usâ€¦whoa"
>> - *Appearance*: Young, fresh faced 
>> - *Does*: Happy to chat, naive, filled with wonder, maybe high all the time? 
>> - *Secret*: Doesn't have any; Valen is an open book 
>
>> [!person] Captured Acolytes
>> - Terrified, but know some useful information about Thanatis's activities if rescued. 
>> - Loyal to Tabath and the temple. 
>> - Just want to survive.

## Monsters

*What monsters might the characters face? What type and quantity of monsters make sense for the situation? Calculate the "[deadly benchmark](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_encounter_benchmark.html)". The encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster Challenge Ratings are greater than one quarter of the sum total of character levels or half if they're above 4th level.*

-   **Deadly Encounter Benchmark:**
	- [[../NPCs/Thanatis-Anelisi-(NPC)|Thanatis Anelisi (NPC)]] 
	- 4 [[../../../../ghoul|Ghouls]]
	- 3 [[../../../../skeleton|Skeletons]]

## Hazards
- **Corruption**
	- For each hour the PCs spend below the temple, each must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Upon failure, he or she is afflicted with an effect from the [[../Adventures/2---The-Horror-in-Hestia#Appendix|Corrupt The Living]]Â table. The effects last for 24 hours.
- **Sinkholes**
	- Sinkholes lurk along the floors of the catacombs. These pits are 30 feet deep. For each round a creature stands in a square adjacent to a pit, there's a 25% chance the square will collapse into a new 5-foot wide, 30-foot deep pit (maximum two per pit).
	- Characters may avoid falling into a pit with aÂ **DC 15 Dexterity**Â saving throw.
## Treasure

*Choose some interesting [treasure](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/5e_treasure.html) and maybe a handful of [relics](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/relics.html).*

The PCs each get 150 gp if they return any of the acolytes and report the status/whereabouts of the lost Hierophant Anelisi. 

The PCs also each get one boon if they are able to bring back alive at least one of the missing acolytes. 

1. **Hatter's Hat** - This stylish hat allows you to cast the Disguise Self spell once per day. The illusion lasts for 1 hour or until you remove the hat, whichever is sooner.
2. **Wind Fan** - When unfolded and waved as an action, this fan creates a 30-foot cone of strong wind originating from you. Creatures in the cone must succeed on a DC13 Strength save or be pushed 15 feet away and knocked prone. The fan has `dice:1d4` charges and regains 1 charge per day/chron. 
3. **Shadowshard** - This glass vial contains light from the Shadowfell (Er's dark echo). As an action, you can uncork it to cast a 30-foot cone of black, ink-like darkness. No natural or magical light may illuminate the area for 1 minute. The contents disperse after a single use. 
4. **Hunter's Draught** - Drinking the contents of this vial grants you advantage on your next attack roll and deals an extra 1d6 damage if the attack hits. The benefits last for 1 minute.
5. **Scroll of Heroism** - When read aloud, grants inspiration to all allied creatures that hear it. Inspiration can be used for advantage on one attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. The scroll is consumed after its use. 

The following relics are on the bodies of the ghouls protecting Thanatis. Presumably they belonged to the original spirits inhabiting these bodies before being defiled by Thanatis's dark magic. 

- Ancient and tarnished copper prayer beads that castÂ [[../../../../detect-evil-and-good|Detect Evil and Good]] (Level 1, DC 12, spell attack +4, page 231) when held and concentrated upon by its possessor.
- Grimy medallion with the stamp of the Opener that casts [[../../../../arms-of-hadar|Arms of Hadar]]Â (Level 1, DC 12, spell attack +4, page 215).

Here is a rollable treasure table with magic items and consumables.
