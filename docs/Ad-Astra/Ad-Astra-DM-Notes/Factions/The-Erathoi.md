The Erathoi are the officially sanctioned religious elect of the Dyarchy. They differ from the followers of Er in their zeal and proselyitizing, as well as their tendency to emphasize the Eran conception of power (as manifested by [[../../../../cleric-power-domain-ermis|Power Domain]] clerics) over infinity and oneness.
