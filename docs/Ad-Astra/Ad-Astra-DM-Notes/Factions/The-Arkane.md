The Arkane are the premier magical society of Ermis. They are nominally under the rule of the Dyarchy, but they consider themselves an autonomous collective. They consist of wizards of all schools. However, one of their primary responsibilities (and sources of income) is in maintaining the functioning of the Spar transport system, as well as the various enchantments that allow Omerth to maintain its position floating at the center of the world. Hence, orimancers and kinemancers feature heavily in the Arkane. So too do the technomancers (artificers) that perform the various engineering feats required to keep travel along the Spar running smoothly. 

The collective interests of the members of the Arkane nominally concern furthering the power of the Dyarchy and the word of Er. However, members of the Arkane are also quite likely to have their own interests, including the furthering of magical knowledge and power. House Tethys has great influence among various members of the Arkane due to its ability to procure unusual items of magic throughout the realm.
