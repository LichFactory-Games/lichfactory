# Differences from Orosen

Both Valtor and Orosen are in the business of technology and engineering. But there are important differences. 

- Valtor specialized in large-scale infrastructure and construction innovations. Orosen focused more on advanced devices, vehicles, and automatons. 
- Valtor uses elemental magic to empower engineering, while Orosen masters more pure arcane magic.
	- For example, Orosen mages might use arcane rituals to imbue an automaton with intelligence and life. Valtor mages would more likely summon and bind elemental spirits to empower a machine with fire energy as its power source.
- Orosen excels at elaborate illusions, teleportation, summoning etc through arcane mastery. Valtor is skilled at using elemental magic to clear land, raise structures, and move massive objects.
- Valtor is more mercantile and values profit, while Orosen prioritizes advancing knowledge and prestige. 
- Valtor has a spirit of competition and trying to surpass Orosen. Orosen aims to maintain their stature as the foremost inventors.
