# Campaign Fronts

Let's use the concept of a [front](https://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/gamemastering#TOC-Fronts) (see also [Sly Flourish on Fronts](https://slyflourish.com/fronts_in_dnd.html)) to flesh out the campaign world. 

Fronts consist of a set of *dangers*, each one representing a faction or a challenge tied to the front. Dangers include many components you might be used to such as a band of orcs, a thieves' guild, or a necromancer summoning a powerful beast. These dangers contain the following components that bring them to life:

- **The Impulse**: The motivation that drives this collection of villainy forward.
- **Grim Portents**: The steps this threat follows when unchecked by the PCs.
- **The Impending Doom**: The conclusion should this threat not be stopped or thwarted.

In the case of Erspace there are various types of dangers, including: 

- Eldritch forces (Yog-Sothoth, Cthulhlu)
- Factions (The Haim, The Fair, The Dyarchy, The Great Houses)
- Arcane Enemies (The A'lhruhyn, The Cult of Hodos)

Let's detail the main aspects of three central fronts for the first part of the campaign.
