This is the lair of the [[../../../../../alhoon-mpmm|alhoon]] triumvirate that controls the outer-disc and experiments on the denizens found there. 

The lair was once home to many illithid, but the triumvirate is all that remains. They desperately wish to escape Erspace and rejoin their brethren on the prime material plane.
