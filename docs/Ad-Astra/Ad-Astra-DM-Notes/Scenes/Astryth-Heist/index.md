Included here are all notes related to the "heist" section of the Escape from Erspace adventure. 

The party is tasked with procuring the [[../../Items/Astranomicon|Astranomicon]], an ancient tome kept in the crypt of [[DM Factions#House Tethys|House Tethys]]. The crypt lies next to and underneath the great house itself. 

The party must enter the crypt, go to the ossuary within, and locate and procure the tome.
