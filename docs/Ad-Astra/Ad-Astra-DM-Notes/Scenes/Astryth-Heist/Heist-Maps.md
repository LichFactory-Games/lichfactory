The party must get onto the [[../../../../assets/img/House-Tethys-(1st-floor).webp|grounds of House Tethys]] and then proceed to the outer crypt. This is visible in the northwest corner of the first floor map. 

Just in case I'll also include the [[../../../../assets/img/House-Tethys-(2nd-floor).webp|second floor map]], but I don't expect anyone to be able to get there.

Once the party has proceeded through the upper crypt they will come to the [[../../../../assets/img/House-Tethys-Crypt.png|lower crypt]].
