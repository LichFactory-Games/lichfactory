# 02 - Main Hall

> [!recite] Read Aloud
> 
> Ample torches cast shimmering pools of light in this room, banishing the darkness and providing a sense of security within the otherwise gloomy jail. Their warm glow flickers across the worn, stone walls, revealing a chamber bustling with activity and purpose.
> This room serves as the main hall for the guard. Sturdy wooden shelves line the walls, laden with supplies and an array of weapons. Stacks of crates, filled with rations, bandages, and spare uniforms, stand ready for distribution. The glint of polished armor catches the eye, accompanied by racks of weapons—swords, spears, and maces—arranged for quick access in times of need. The room bears the weight of constant use and minimal maintenance, evident in the scuffs and scratches on the stone floors.
> 
> To the north, the main entrance to the jail beckons. The entranceway is guarded by two vigilant sentinels, ever watchful for any signs of intrusion or trouble. 
> 
> To the south, a sturdy staircase descends into darkness, leading to the foreboding depths where the cells are housed. The clanging of metal bars and muffled voices echo up the staircase.
