# Astryth Jail

## Characters


## Background

The PCs were all arrested the previous night. They were caught up in a sweep of the city by Dyarchy forces trying to restore order after a series of major thefts and kidnappings occurred. Each player can determine how their character was captured. The PCs themselves  have only foggy memories of how they arrived there. They may not have all arrived together (or even know one another). There are odd and terrible events going on in this jail. The PCs must escape.

**There is a violent event.**Â An NPC has a seizure and ultimately dies. There is no amount of healing that will save them. While seizing, a rat swarm appears. This is a swarm of cranium rats. They will not instigate a fight, as they are here to observe the outcome of the "infection" or transformation on offer from the NPC. Since it is death they are ultimately uninterested. The will not attack the PCs unless attacked themselves, though they will be notable to any PCs with psionic powers, or to the observant more generally. The rat swarm will flee if its hit points go below 50%.

## Strong Start

> [!recite]
> You all awake in a jail. You have only foggy memories of how you arrived here. As you begin to look around, you notice that the walls of the cell are thick and made of stone. The only light comes from small torches high up on the walls that barely illuminate the cells and hallway. There is a foul smell in the air, and strange noises can be heard coming from down the corridor.
> 
> There are no guards in sight. However, there are several other cells lining both sides of the corridor, and you can hear other prisoners talking, yelling, and occasionally, screaming. 
> 
> As you try to piece together your memories you realize that all of your belongings are gone, including any weapons or tools that you may have had.
> 
> One of the other prisoners in a nearby cell is chuckling to himself as he notices your confusion and calls out to you. "Hey, newbies! What are you in for?".

# Secret and Clues

*What ten [secrets and clues](https://slyflourish.com/sharing_secrets.html) might the characters uncover? Secrets might be related to the characters, NPCs, locations, bits of history, or quests. Drop in secrets as appropriate during the game.*

#### Previous

-   [ ] Inmates are being experimented upon. 
-   [ ] Some of the guards are crooked. 
-   [ ] Not everything in this jail is as it seems.
-   [ ] There is a way out of the jail via the sewers. 
-   [ ] The rats seem to be watching the inmates. 
-   [ ] The Dyarchy is cracking down on its citizens. 
-   [ ] The guards seem most interested in people coming through that look like they might be "adventurers". 
-   [ ] Rumor has it that someone is seeking to rob one of the great houses.

#### Hop Gar Karenikos (Guard/Intellect Devourer)
1.  Unusual Behavior: The guard displays subtle changes in behavior and demeanor. He becomes increasingly secretive, often seen communicating with mysterious figures or acting strangely when certain topics, such as the artifact or the Alhoon, are mentioned.    
2.  Eerie Coincidences: Strange events occur both within the jail and in other areas of Astryth. People start disappearing under mysterious circumstances, and rumors of unexplained phenomena spread. These occurrences seem to align with the guard's interactions or actions, raising suspicions about his involvement.
3.  Cryptic Messages: The guard inadvertently drops cryptic notes or fragments of messages that hint at his allegiance or intentions. These messages could contain phrases like "the depths hold the key" or "the Alhoon's power grows."
4.  Unsettling Aura: People who spend prolonged time around the guard notice an unsettling aura or sense of dread. Animals become restless or agitated in his presence, sensing the malevolent influence of the intellect devourer within him.
5.  Connections to Dark Forces: Through investigation or interaction with other NPCs, the party discovers that the guard has connections to individuals involved in dark rituals or forbidden knowledge, indicating his involvement with the Alhoon or their nefarious plans.
6.  Unexplained Knowledge: The guard possesses information that he shouldn't logically have access to, such as detailed knowledge of the artifact or the Alhoon's goals. This raises suspicion about the source of his information and suggests his deeper involvement.

# Fantastic Locations

*What fantastic locations might the characters explore? Think of these like the backdrop to a scene in a play. You'll generally want one location for every 45 minutes of gameplay you're expecting. Give each location one or more interesting features the characters might interact with. Try some [inspirational monuments](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/monuments.html). Make these new pages if you want to add maps or details.*

-   **Location 1**: The jail, barracks, other cells 
-   **Location 2**: The sewer, paths to the undercity 

# NPCs

*What [NPCs](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/npc_generator.html) might the characters interact with?
