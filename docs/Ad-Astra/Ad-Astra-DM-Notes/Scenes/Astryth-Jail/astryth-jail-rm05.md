# 05 - The Jail

> [!recite] Read Aloud
> The Jail contains a long central hallway with nine cells and a storage room branching of of it. Two large braziers light the central hall and frame  steps leading up to the barracks. Torches hang from the walls giving off a flickering light that serves to shroud almost as much as it reveals. The air is filled with a fetid stink and the sounds of various jailed inmates quietly murmuring to themselves or one another. There is the occasional clank of a chain against the stone floor.
