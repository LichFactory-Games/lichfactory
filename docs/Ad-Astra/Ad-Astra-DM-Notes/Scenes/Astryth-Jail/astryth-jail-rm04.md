# 04 - The Way Out

> [!recite] Read Aloud
> This cell room is much larger than the others, but also quite spare. The sole furnishing is a small bench against the east wall. Perhaps it sometimes functions as a holding cell of sorts. There are roots growing out of the walls. Along the east wall there is a large sewer grate. Given the overall slope of the cell chamber, this may act as a kind of storm drain for the cell block, allowing detritus and excess moisture to drain naturally down into the sewers. 

- The sewer grate is somewhat heavy -- DC 11 strength check to move it. 
- The pipe is big enough to allow one medium size creature at a time. 
	- The pipe is filthy -- DC 11 dex check to avoid slipping in it 
	- The pipe leads into a vertical tunnel. There is an 8 foot drop, and a ladder the PCs can use to climb down. 
	- If the PCs fail Dex check then they need to make one more to grab the ladder to avoid falling the whole drop and taking damage.
