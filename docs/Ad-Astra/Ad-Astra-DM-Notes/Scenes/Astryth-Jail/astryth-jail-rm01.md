# 01 - Barracks

> [!recite] Read Aloud
> This cramped chamber houses the weary guards tasked with maintaining order within the jail's cellblock. The room is divided into several narrow cots, each made of rough-hewn wood and meagerly furnished with thin, scratchy blankets and worn pillows. The cots are arranged in a neat row against the walls, leaving a narrow aisle between each of them. There is a small table and chairs in the south east corner, and a large worn locker in the north east corner.
