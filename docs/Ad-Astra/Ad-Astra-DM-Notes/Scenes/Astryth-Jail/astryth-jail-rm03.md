# 03 - Guard Commander Office

> [!recite] Read Aloud
> There is a modest desk and chairs in the north-west corner of this room. A chest is on the opposite wall. There is an empty holding cell to the south. Standing in the torchlight is a large bald man. His face is bearded, with visible scars on his cheekbones. He is perhaps in his 50s, but is muscled and fierce looking. He has on the armor of the city watch, festooned with the ribbons and colors of an officer. He is speaking with another guard.  

- The man is Loch Eryn Blackmoor. He is the head of the city watch, and is here investigating issues with the jail.
