# 01 - Entrance

> [!recite]
> Emerging from the passage, you find yourself in the damp and odorous depths of the sewers. The air is heavy with the stench of rot and waste, assaulting your senses with its pungent and unpleasant aroma. Flickering torchlight casts eerie shadows along the slimy, moss-covered walls.
> 
> Water trickles and flows along the uneven cobblestone walkways, forming shallow rivulets that meander through the grimy passage. The sound of dripping echoes through the tunnels, creating an unsettling symphony of intermittent splashes. The occasional rat scurries by, its beady eyes reflecting the dim light as it seeks refuge from your presence.
> 
> Your footsteps echo in the dampness, and the slick, slimy surfaces underfoot make each step a precarious one. A hallway stretches before you. 

- There is a torch that is seemingly lit by  [[../../../../../continual-flame|magical means]].
- There is a door at the end of the hallway -- it is closed but unlocked, though it may take some force to open it, as there is corrosion on the hinges. 
- The hallway is otherwise unremarkable
