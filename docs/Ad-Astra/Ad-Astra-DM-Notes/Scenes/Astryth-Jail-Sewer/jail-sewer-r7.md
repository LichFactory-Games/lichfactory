# 07 - The Rusted Gate

> [!recite] Read Aloud
> You see what appears to be a rusted and grimy gate. There is no discernable lock, but the hinges seem to be designed to snap shut on a kind of spring mechanism. Through the bars beyond you can see a wide corridor and what looks to be a scene of extreme gore. Blood spatters the floor and walls and in the dim light you can just barely make out the shapes of broken weapons strewn about the floor, as well as that of a humanoid figure.  It seems to be flopping about and making faint whispering sounds. 

> [!info]
> - The door can be opened with a DC 13 strength check.
> - Alternatively, the spring mechanism could be disabled with a DC 12 intelligence check 

> [!important|color-red] Encounter 
> The movement is not caused by the person, but by the maggot swarm that infests it.
