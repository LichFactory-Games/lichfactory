## General Notes

1. There is no "correct" way through the sewer 
2. There are multiple possible exits from the sewer 
	- If the PCs got a sewer key they can leave from any of the exits on the east side. 
	- There is a key in the ghast room that unlocks the grate leading out of that room 
	- Depending on the general health of the party and their route, the grates can all be locked and need a key that cannot be found except in the ghast room; if the PCs are in bad shape, or the GM wants to move things along, one of the grates on the east side can simply be unlocked. 

3. Guard will meet the PCs in a tavern if they survive.  Spellcasters can get back their spellbooks this way; and if anyone else has any expensive kit they might get this back as well. 
4. If PCs don't interact with guard prior to getting out they will either find a note next to a small cache of items in the sewer, or one of the inmates can give them the info. 
5. There should be defined consequences for spending more than a round in the sewer water -- presumably catching disease. Also the areas by the pipes are trecherous. If anyone falls or steps in the canal they are going to have to make a dex save or be swept from their feet and down the canal. They won't go far, but they will certainly take in sewage.
