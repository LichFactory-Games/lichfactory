# 08 - Southern Canal

> [!recite] Read Aloud
> A cross shaped canal runs down the center of this room. There is blood spattered and smeared along the walls and floor, leading off into the next passageway. Across the canal you hear more skittering and in the faint light can just make out the gleaming eyes of two very large rats. 

- The encounter with the giant rats is optional. The PCs can back away slowly down the corridor without being attacked, though if they approach the rats or otherwise provoke them the encounter is unavoidable.

- If the PCs follow the blood trail it takes them to another door, which is also on a spring latch, though unlocked. Its hinges look rusty and the entire door seems precariously hung.

> - DC 12 strength check to open the door
> - DC 11 intelligence check to disconnect the spring 
> - DC 14 stealth check to get the door open without it squeaking/scraping
