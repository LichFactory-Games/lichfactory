# 03 - North Canal

> [!recite] Read Aloud
> As you walk around the curve of the canal, it continues to glow with the eerie bio-luminous algae. You see two large pipes dumping water into the canal. Perhaps it rained recently because there is a great deal of water gushing from the pipes, enough to make it somewhat hard to hear while traversing the hall. Large rats skitter along the floor, their eyes gleaming. They stop to look at you with chattering teeth. 
> 
> Midway down the corridor is a vestibule leading into what looks like another hallway. 
> 
> The end of the corridor bends to the south out of view. 

- The rats may or may not attack. If unprovoked they will move away, toward either the boneless creature in the next room or towards the other rats in the western part of the canal.
