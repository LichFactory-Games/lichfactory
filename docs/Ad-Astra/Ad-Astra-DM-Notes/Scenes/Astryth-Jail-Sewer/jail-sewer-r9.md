# 09 - Zombieland!

> [!recite] Read Aloud 
> The door opens into a chamber thick with a sickly stench of decay and dampness. The flickering light of your torch reveals a scene of grim horror. The chamber is dominated by a large pile of bones, heaped in the middle of the room. The bones are a macabre mosaic, forming a grotesque collage of various humanoid and beastly remains. Some skulls bear jagged marks, hinting at violent ends.
> 
> This is where the blood trail ends, intermingling with the grime and filth, leading to a grisly cluster of dark stains near the center of the chamber. The stains suggest recent carnage. 
> 
> As your gaze follows the trail, your eyes are drawn to the presence of several zombies lurking near the bones. Their gaunt, pale forms crouch low, their sunken eyes burning with an insatiable hunger. With bared teeth, these reanimated horrors exude an aura of malevolence. They eye you hungrily, ready to pounce upon any living flesh that comes within their reach.
> 
> But the true terror lies deeper within the chamber. From the darkest recesses emerges a putrescent form, its fetid stench preceding its ghastly visage. Taller and more imposing than the zombies, the walking plauge's pallid flesh is stretched tightly across its skeletal frame. Its eyes glow with an unholy fire, and a wicked intelligence gleams within them. The corpse emits a low, guttural growl, as if relishing the imminent feast that awaits.
