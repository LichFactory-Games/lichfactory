# 02 - NW Junction

> [!recite]
> The door opens into a wide tunnel. To the north and south are softly glowing canals of sludge,   glittering with bio-luminescent algae. The northern canal bends down the hall to the east, while the southern canal seems to proceed into a larger room. You hear the soft "plip-plop" of water dripping and the skittering of small creatures. Whether they are rats, or insects, or something else, you do not know. 

- There are no creatures to encounter here. 
- The PCs must choose which direction to proceed. 
- They have been told that there is an exit to the east, but it is unclear which direction N or S is the best way to go to get there
