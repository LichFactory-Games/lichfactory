## Characters

## Background

The PCs have escaped the jail by going into the sewers of [[../../../Player's-Almanac/Astryth|Astryth]] . 

## Strong Start
> [!recite]
> Emerging from the passage, you find yourself in the damp and odorous depths of the sewers. The air is heavy with the stench of rot and waste, assaulting your senses with its pungent and unpleasant aroma. Flickering torchlight casts eerie shadows along the slimy, moss-covered walls.
> 
> Water trickles and flows along the uneven cobblestone walkways, forming shallow rivulets that meander through the grimy passage. The sound of dripping echoes through the tunnels, creating an unsettling symphony of intermittent splashes. The occasional rat scurries by, its beady eyes reflecting the dim light as it seeks refuge from your presence.
> 
> Your footsteps echo in the dampness, and the slick, slimy surfaces underfoot make each step a precarious one.

# Fantastic Locations

*What fantastic locations might the characters explore? Think of these like the backdrop to a scene in a play. You'll generally want one location for every 45 minutes of gameplay you're expecting. Give each location one or more interesting features the characters might interact with. Try some [inspirational monuments](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/monuments.html). Make these new pages if you want to add maps or details.*

-   **Location 1**: feature, feature, feature
-   **Location 2**: feature, feature, feature

# NPCs

*What [NPCs](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/npc_generator.html) might the characters interact with? Give them an interesting [name](https://slyflourish.com/random_name_generator.html) and use an archetype from a movie for their mannerisms. Make these new pages if you want to keep track of more information or add pictures.*

# Monsters

*What monsters might the characters face? What type and quantity of monsters make sense for the situation? Calculate the "[deadly benchmark](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_encounter_benchmark.html)". The encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster Challenge Ratings are greater than one quarter of the sum total of character levels or half if they're above 4th level.*

## Hazards


# Treasure

*Choose some interesting [treasure](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/5e_treasure.html) and maybe a handful of [relics](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/relics.html).*
