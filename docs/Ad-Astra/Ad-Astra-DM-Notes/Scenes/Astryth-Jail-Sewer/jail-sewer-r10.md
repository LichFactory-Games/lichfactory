# 10 - Rats & Mushrooms


> [!recite] Read Aloud
> 
> The faint green glow emanating from the iridescent fungus lining the canal's edges casts an eerie luminescence across the damp surroundings. Puddles of stagnant water dot the floor, reflecting the dim light from above. The water within seems thick and muddied, concealing whatever lies beneath its rippled surface. The occasional drip echoes through the chamber, merging with the incessant trickle of the sewer canal.
> 
> Amidst the dampness, your light upon a grotesque sight—a pile of bones piled against one wall. It is unclear whether they were put there or as the result of overflow from the canal. The skeletal remnants seem to a mix of a variety of creatures, a macabre monument to whatever unfortunate souls met their end in this wretched place. 
> 
> Perhaps unsurprisingly, the stench of decay draws more than just dampness in this forsaken chamber. From the shadows emerge four hulking figures—giant rats, their beady eyes gleaming with hunger. Their fur, matted and diseased, bristles as they scuttle forward, drawn by the scent of intruders. These verminous creatures, each the size of a small dog, bear sharp, yellowed incisors ready to tear into any flesh that ventures too close.

Note that the rats are diseased. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a **DC 10 Constitution** saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.

> Your eyes are drawn to a vibrant spectacle that seems almost otherworldly. Illuminating the darkness, an array of fungi coat the walls and floor, emitting a soft, ethereal glow. The mushrooms are varied in size, shape, and color, creating a mesmerizing tapestry of luminescent hues. 
> 
> As you venture closer, you notice that the air in the chamber carries a faint, earthy aroma, intermingled with a hint of sweetness. A glow emanates from the mushrooms themselves, casting a gentle, iridescent illumination that bathes the entire corner of the chamber. Their radiant light casts intricate patterns on the rough, moss-covered stone walls, giving the illusion of a starry night sky within this underground realm.
> 
> The soft glow of the mushrooms reveals a carpet of moss and delicate fungi underfoot, each seemingly a part of this enchanting ecosystem. Tiny spores waft through the air, creating an almost magical ambiance. It is as if nature herself has woven a hidden sanctuary within this forsaken sewer, a testament to life's resilience even in the darkest of places.
