# 06 - East Chamber

> [!recite] Read Aloud
> Eerie shadows dance across the damp surfaces of this room, as it catches the light from the nearby canals. Your senses are assaulted by the pungent stench of decay and stagnant water, which lies heavy in the air around you. In the center of the chamber, a large puddle stretches out, its surface reflecting the sickly green glow of the bioluminescent fungus from the nearby canals. The water is murky, concealing whatever lies beneath its still surface, and its foul odor permeates the room. As you shift your gaze around the room, you notice scattered bones strewn across the damp ground. They seem a mix of humanoid and animal, along with trash and unidentifiable artifacts. As you look the ground around the pool seems to ripple and swell. 

> [!info]
> - The corridors to the west, south, and east all lead to manholes. One is locked (west) but the other two can serve as exits, at the DM's discretion. 
> - There is a locked gate in the main hall connecting this part of the sewer to the rest. The key to the lock can be found in the [[./old---jail-sewer-r9|old - jail sewer r9]].  
>   - The gate lock may be picked with thieves tools on a DC 14. Without tools it may be brute-forced on a DC 19 strength check. 

> [!important|color-orange] 
> Make a DC 12 perception check -- if it succeeds the PCs notice that there is [[../../../../../swarm-of-rats|a swarm of rats]] moving about the room, feasting on the detritus. If the PCs fail, they are suprised by the rat swarm, which will attack them. 


> [!recite] Read Aloud
> Suddenly, a cacophony of high-pitched squeaks and the scurrying of tiny feet fills the chamber. From the shadows a swarm of rats emerges, their beady red eyes glinting with hunger as they surround the puddle. They scuttle about in a frenzied frenzy, gnawing on bones and scraps of decaying matter with insatiable appetites. Their wiry bodies and matted fur seem to merge into a seething mass of vermin as they scavenge for sustenance.
> 
> The rats pay little attention to your presence at first, preoccupied with their macabre feast. However, as you move further into the room, the sound of your footsteps echoes through the chamber, drawing their attention. With a collective hiss, they halt their feeding frenzy, their beady eyes fixated on you. Their tiny fangs gnash in anticipation, a stark reminder that you've entered their domain and that they're ready to defend it.
