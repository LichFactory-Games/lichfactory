> The Astranomicon is an ancient book, it's rich purple cover now worn and stained. The book is bound closed by a small gold clasp.  There may perhaps have been a sigil or symbol on the front cover, but it is now so worn away as to be illegible – it is almost as if it were scratched out. The pattern of wear plays tricks on the eye, as if it depicted stars swirling in the void.  Perhaps it is best that one not focus on the cover for too long a time … 

 The Astranomicon contains a wealth of knowledge for those who can decipher its cryptic texts. It delves into various aspects of spelljamming, detailing the intricacies of astral navigation, the nature of different celestial bodies, and the laws that govern space-time. It unveils secrets of the crystal spheres, including information on unique phenomena, hidden realms, and dangerous astral creatures. 

The Astranomicon is written in a variety of languages, including Fey/Faeir, Draconic, Abyssal, and Aklo. Learning Aklo is required if the reader wishes to be able to cast any of its spells. A character whose Intelligence is 15 or greater can become proficient in Aklo by studying the book for a month (this need not be continuous study), though such study brings significant dangers with it.

Additionally, the Astranomicon holds accounts of long-lost civilizations, forgotten pantheons, and esoteric rituals tied to the mysteries of the cosmos. It unveils the secrets of celestial magic, granting insights into powerful spells that tap into the energies of the stars. However, it also contains warnings and cautionary tales, revealing the potential dangers of meddling with forces beyond mortal understanding.

> The Astranomicon is, among other things, a link to the Far Realm. This connection is sufficiently strong that anyone opening the book must make a charisma saving throw, DC 13. If they fail they will obsess about the book, and spend any time that they can pouring over its pages. Each day the reader must make a further DC 13 check. Two failures in a row results in a loss of a Charisma point. If the reader's Charisma is reduced to zero, they become a babbling idiot – and a seer of Yog-Sothoth.
