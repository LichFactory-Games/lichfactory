The book of occult fragments of the Eran doctrine is of unknown origins and contains a variety of different occult rites and spells. Prominent among these is the *Ritus Cranii Vitae Mortis* ("The skull ritual of life and death"), which allows for the creation of a [[./Runeskull|Runeskull]], aiding in the raising and control of unusually resilient and intelligent undead. 

The *Fragments* are written in a mixture of languages. There are Fey/Faeir passages, draconic, Abyssal, and Aklo. Most of the actual rites are written in Aklo. A character whose Intelligence is 15 or greater can become proficient in Aklo by studying the book for a month (this need not be continuous study), though such study brings significant dangers with it.

> The *Fragments* contain material that may both obsess the reader and disturb their mind. Anyone spending an hour studying the book must make a [[Wisdom|Wisdom]] saving throw, DC 12. If they fail they will obsess about the book, and want it near them at all times. Each day the reader must make another DC 12 check to shake off the effects. If the reader fails two checks in a row, deduct two Wisdom points. Once the reader's Wisdom reaches 0 they are driven totally insane (roll on the permanent insanity table). This effect can only be removed by a [[../../../../greater-restoration|Greater Restoration]] spell or its equivalent.

The book was sent via mail to [[../NPCs/Thanatis-Anelisi-(NPC)|Thanatis Anelisi (NPC)]]. Though initially intellectually curious, the book can arouse in its reader a furious obsession with its subject matter, as well as a general warping of the reader's sensibility.
