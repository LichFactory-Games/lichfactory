*Wondrous item, major, rare*

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: --
- **Weight**: 4 oz

This humanoid skull has been etched with runes and a gem inserted into its cyclopean orifice. The secret of constructing a Runeskull is a relic of ancient fell sorcerery used to raise undead and communicate with ancient beings. A burning emerald glows in the cyclopean skull's lone eye socket. Strange secrets leech from its hollows in an echoing whisper.

- While the Runeskull does not have specific game statistics, the scope and nature of its abilities can be de1ined by the GM. For the purposes of this adventure, it grants its bonded wielder lair actions and the power to animate unusually intelligent undead.

- The Runeskull has an AC of 14 and 30 hit points. Its effects end if destroyed.

*Custom wondrous item.*
