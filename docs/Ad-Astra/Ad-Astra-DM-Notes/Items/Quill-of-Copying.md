A Quill of Copying is a minor magic item that allows the user to flawlessly copy written text or symbols. Its abilities are:

- As an action, the user touches the quill to any written text and speaks the command word. The quill then copies the text perfectly onto another surface the user designates.
- The quill can copy text covering an area of up to 1 foot by 1 foot. The copied text looks like normal writing in fresh black ink.
- The copied text remains until washed or scraped away. It does not detect as magical.
- The quill can be used 3 times per day. Used charges reset at dawn.
- If the user tries to copy magical text such as scroll spells or glyphs, the quill has no effect. The quill also cannot duplicate magical properties of writing.
