*Wondrous item, minor, common*

![spell-gem](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e6/ee/20/e6ee205765ce4a44d412072cb692c36d.jpg) 

- **Properties**: Consumable 
- **Cost**: 20 gp
- **Weight**: 1 oz

This gem contains a single use of a 1st or 2nd level spell that can be cast from it. The spell must be cast at its lowest possible level. Once cast, the gem becomes dull until recharged by a spellcaster casting the same spell into it. If targeted by dispel magic, the gem turns to worthless powder.

*Custom wondrous item.*
