### Cosmicus Traversus Annulus (Transverse Ring)

*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement

The transverse ring facilitates the traversal of celestial planes and dimensions within the Orrery. When attuned to this component, you gain proficiency in Wisdom (Insight) checks, allowing you to perceive the subtle shifts in the cosmic weave.
