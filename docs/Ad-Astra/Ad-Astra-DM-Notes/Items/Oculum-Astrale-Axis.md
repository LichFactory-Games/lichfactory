### Oculum Astrale Axis (Eye Spindle)

*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Weight**: ––

The central spindle with a single jewel at its core serves as the conduit for cosmic energies, akin to a celestial eye. While attuned to this component, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. Additionally, once per day, you can use an action (whether or not you are a spell caster) to cast [[../../../../arcane-eye|Arcane Eye]]. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until the next day.
