### Astrum Ancora (Anchor Gear)

*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Weight**:  ––

The anchor gear serves as a stabilizing force for the Orrery's cosmic energies. While attuned to this component, you have advantage on saving throws against any effect that would move you magically or alter your location, such as teleportation or planar shifts. Additionally, you can use an action to anchor yourself and create a protective ward. For 1 minute, you gain resistance to all damage from spells and magical effects. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until the next dawn.
