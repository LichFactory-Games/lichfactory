- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

The *Via Astra* is a delicate and exquisitely crafted clockwork orrery, featuring multiple geared components whose sweeping hands and dials represent the complex interplay of interstellar and planar forces. Standing over a foot high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the true power of the orrery lies in its five clockwork components and their integration into a single working whole.

The original creator of the Via Astra is unknown. But it dates at least to the Age of Sundering, and is likely older. The orrery seem initially to be a highly advanced tool for navigation in and between wildspace systems. But it is in fact much more than this. It provides a means to navigate between any to points anywhere in existence, and so not only on the prime material plane, but literally *anywhere*. It is even rumored that its navigational powers include travel to any point in *time* as well. 

However, this great power comes at a cost. The maker of the orrery somehow tapped into the power of the Great Old One, Yog-Sothoth. Eventually, use of the orrery impresses upon its user irrational desires, as their finite mind is challenged by its attempts to comprehend the multiplicity of existence. These desires eventually culminate in the intention to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm, and to bring into our present reality Yog-Sothoth itself. It has been used for this purpose exactly once, and the consequences of that nearly destroyed Erspace. 

To prevent the orrery from ever again being so used, the components that powered it were scattered, secreted across the entirety of Erspace. But the orrery strives for its complete totality, and so its components have a way of inexorably coming together over time, whether decades or centuries. Parts have been found by treasure hunters and then lost again, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again—but each time moving closer to the others until the way is opened once again. 

Random Properties. The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:

- 2 [[../../../../artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties|Minor Beneficial Properties]]
- 1 [[../../../../artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties|Major Beneficial Properties]]
- 1 [[../../../../artifact-properties-major-detrimental-properties|Major Detrimental Properties]]

The random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing.

## The Sum of Its Parts

Each of the five components that powers the orrery is a powerful magic relic in its own right:

1. Backing plate ([[./Cosmum-Placca|Cosmum Placca]])
2. Anchor gear ([[./Astrum-Ancora|Astrum Ancora]])
3. Hub gear ([[./Astrum-Nucleus|Astrum Nucleus]])
4. Transverse ring ([[./Cosmicus-Traversus-Annulus|Cosmicus Traversus Annulus]])
5. Eye spindle ([[./Oculum-Astrale-Axis|Oculum Astrale Axis]]) 

Creatures can attune to the orrery's components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn't count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.

While a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.

## Anticipate the Future

With or without all of its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

## Open the Way

With or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with tumultuous energy. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms.

## Walk the Path

While all five components of the Via Astra are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): [contact other plane](../../../../contact-other-plane.md) (3 charges), [demiplane](../../../../demiplane.md) (6 charges), [gate](../../../../gate.md) (7 charges), [plane shift](../../../../plane-shift.md) (5 charges), or [teleportation circle](../../../../teleportation-circle.md) (3 charges). The orrery regains `dice:1d4 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn.
