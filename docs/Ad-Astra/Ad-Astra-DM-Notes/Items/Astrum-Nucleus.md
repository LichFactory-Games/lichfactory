### Astrum Nucleus (Hub Gear)

*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Weight**: ––

The hub gear acts as the core support structure, connecting and harmonizing the various celestial gears within the Orrery. While attuned to this component, you gain proficiency in Charisma (Persuasion) checks, as your presence becomes magnetically charismatic. Additionally, once per day, you can use an action to invoke the Astral Radiance. This ability bathes you in radiant light, granting you resistance to radiant and necrotic damage for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until the next dawn.
