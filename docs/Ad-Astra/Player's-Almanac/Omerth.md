The capital city of the [[../../../The Dyarchy|The Dyarchy]] (and unofficially of [[./Ermis|Ermis]]). It is the set of autocratic power on the planet. It incorporates both the [[./The-Arkanum|The Arkanum]] and the [[./Dunamikon|Dunamikon]]. It is also the residence of [[../../../The Dyarchy|The Dyarchy]]. 

It exists solely due to the great technological and magical powers of its wizards and technomancers. Otherwise gravity at the center does not exist, and powerful electromagnetic currents would arc uncontrolled through the area.
