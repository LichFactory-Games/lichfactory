Astryth is one of two major cities on [[./Ermis|Ermis]], sister to the city Eryth. It is the original home of [[../../../Vires|Vires]]. Astryth is slightly smaller than [[./Eryth|Eryth]] but also has a more varied surrounding landscape, encompassing, plains, mountains, desert, and forest. The core of the old city is located at the southern base of the [[./The-Spar|The Spar]]. 

Astryth consists of multiple levels as it carves its way up the foot of the Spar. Lower Extremis, Ward Demos, and part of Ward Sophos are on the lower slope. Ward Aurum, Ward Emporos, and the Citadel, are all on the upper slope of the base of the Spar. 

Astryth also has an "undercity", which is a network of passages and sewers that lead throughout the city. The undercity is also connected to the so-called "underdark" which is a deeper network of caverns and tunnels that lead into the mountains. From both the undercity and the underdark one can find passages leading to the tunnels of the [[../../../Sil|Sil]] in the northern wastes of the [[./Kypar-desert|Kypar desert]].

## Entering the City

Most travelers arrive in Astryth via the network of roads that converge on the city. There are no gates or walls surrounding the city, but there are various checkpoints, and the Watch patrols the major roads, especially Magna Platea (runs east-west) and Via Kyper (runs north-south). The mountain passage of the Spar grants direct access from Eryth, while other roads lead from the surrounding plains, forests, and villages.

## A Short History of Astryth

Astryth was founded generations ago (several metachrons) at the base of the Verdoun Mountains. As the settlement grew over time, it expanded across several terraces carved into the mountain slopes. 

The accumulation of generational wealth has led to a highly stratified society. City politics and commerce are largely under the control and purview of the two great houses, Tethys and Xeryth. The engineering of the Spar is largely due to the work of Xeryth in Astryth and the Houses Orosen and Valtor in Eryth. Spar transit took nearly a myriachron to engineer and build, but was finally finished in kilochron 110 PD (*Prin Diarchian*). The success of Spar travel and especially trade brought an increase in conflict between the Great Houses, which was eventually resolved through the establishment of the Dyarchy and the reign of the first Dyad in 1 MD (*Meta Diarchian*). Prior to the construction of Omerth in 87 MD, the Dyad would alternate their presence between Eryth and Astryth. The Citadel was their seat of power, and today still constitutes their administrative presence, with the Arkane, Gnostari, and Hegemon all sharing buildings in the Citadel. 

Major events include the 342 PD founding of the Arkane College *Lyceum Miskatonis*, 12 PD overthrow of the leader of House Tethys, Mordechai Azhad-Gul, and the 78 MD election of Chancellor Allisandra Venturi. Astryth has endured plagues, famines, succession struggles, and occasional attacks by Scro, Goblinoids, and other creatures issuing from the mountains and desert wastes.

Today the city covers over 35 square miles and houses over 250,000 inhabitants. It remains a key stop for overland trade routes and hosts a thriving community of artisans, merchants, and academics.


## Wards of Astryth

The Ward Emporos houses markets, guilds, and shops. The Ward Sophos contains the Collegia Miskatonis, as well as a variety of libraries, manuscript dealers, and purveyors of magic. The wealthy typically dwell in Ward Aurum. Ward Demos, as well as Upper and Lower Exremis largely house workers and the poor. An undercity lies beneath parts of the city, particularly Ward Demos. 

## City Government

Astryth is governed by the Council of Three - the Chancellor, High Arkanist, and High Inquisitor. These are appointed by the leaders of House Tethys and Xeryth, after several rounds of voting by the other houses and the lower Ward Demos. The Council oversees the bureaucracy, city guard, taxes, laws, and foreign relations. They strive to balance the interests of the four wards.

## Surviving in the City

New arrivals should secure lodging in an inn or boarding house, then seek work through markets, guilds, or temples. The lower wards offer cheaper housing but more dangerous streets, so go armed and be cautious at night. Beware pickpockets in the bazaar crowds. The laws of the city are many, and can be complex for newcomers. Punishment of infraction can be quite harsh. At the minimum, newcomers to the city often find themselves quickly facing the choice between payment of a fine and spending a night in one of the city jails. 

Magic and technology are also strictly regulated. While many occupants of the city have some sort of facility with magic, typically the public use of magic more significant than that of a cantrip is frowned upon unless one is a clear member of the Arkane order or another municipally-sanctioned organization. This is also true of technology, especially anything that seems like it could be used as a weapon (e.g. absolutely no open display of firearms unless you are a member of the Hetai). Violations of these rules will lead to swift fine and punishment by the Watch. 

## Notable Features

Sites include the Temple of Vires, Catacombs of the Revered, the gambling parlor Fortune's Wheel, the Blessed Baths hot springs, and many taverns, inns, shops, and warehouses.

## Holidays & Festivals

Major celebrations include equinox festivals on the steps of the various temples, the masked Revelry of Fools, Viresday honoring Astryth's contribution to the Dyarchy, and the Parade of Colors. Festivals feature feasting, dancing, games, and street fairs. They typically take place on the first Chron (Mondia) of every Decachron (Monoseptem) of every Hectochron (MonomÄ“n). 

## Commerce

Astryth trades in ores, furs, timber, livestock, and crafted goods. Major guilds include Jewelers, Potters, Scribes, and Weavers. The markets offer wares imported over the Spar from Eryth. Coin flows freely in the gambling dens and brothels. The Commercium, at the center of the old city in Astryth, is the main area for trade and evaluation of goods travelling to and from the Spar, as well as to or from the coastal regions beyond the Dunwold or the Western Vardoun range.  

## Religion

Most follow the pantheon of Er. Various temples and shrines dedicated to this pantheon operate in the wards, with the most opulent being in Aurum. However, in part because of Er's somewhat abstruse nature, and in part because of the seeming infinite variety of Er's manifestations, there are a number of different groups, cults, and forms of religious praxis that have flourished in Astryth. Among these include the followers of Hodos the Opener, the Order of the Silver Key, and Telios Mechanicus. The Syndicate of the King in Yellow claims devotees in the undercity. Druidic old faiths persist in areas of the city and surrounding countryside.
