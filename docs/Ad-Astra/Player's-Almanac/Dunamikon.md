The Dunamikon designates both a sacred building in the capital city, [[./Omerth|Omerth]], and the religious orders that reside in it. 

The Dunamikon contains two orders of the Dunamis (the power) -- [[../Ad-Astra-DM-Notes/Factions/The-Erathoi|The Erathoi]], or the Clerics of Er, and [[../Ad-Astra-DM-Notes/Factions/The-Gnostari|The Gnostari]], which are the [[../../../psion-ermis|psionic]] arm of the Dyarchy. Both orders are known for their religious zealotry.

Together, the Erathoi and the Gnostari are the "hand" of the Dyarchy (with the Hetai being its "fist").
