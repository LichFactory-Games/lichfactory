# Eranism

The Eran religion is centered on the worship and contemplation of [[./Er|Er]], the singular substance that comprises the unity of all things. Er is equated with Nature and the totality of existence.

Followers of the Erian religion, called Erans, seek to develop an intuitive understanding of Er through reason, scientific inquiry, meditation, and ethical living. By using philosophy and science to comprehend the natural world, Erans deepen their perception of the divine order underlying all creation.

Erans have no dogma, clergy, or supernatural beliefs. Their practices emphasize self-cultivation, study, and intellectual reflection. Virtues such as wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice are developed in harmony with Nature. Passions are moderated through reason.

Local congregations are led by guides or "Hierophants", who have demonstrated profound wisdom and deep understanding of Er. Their role is to inspire learning and lead meditative practices, not prescribe morality. Congregants are called "seekers" ("Zētētai").

Contemplators gather in simple meeting halls to engage in silent meditation, philosophical discussion, and contemplative walks observing Nature. Most pursue secular careers and interests, coming together periodically for spiritual nourishment.

Ritual is minimal, with seekers sharing simple meals as an expression of unity. Music, poetry, and dance may be incorporated if conducive to contemplation. Eran holidays mark the changing seasons and equinoxes.

Erans seek mystical moments of transcendence through contemplation, but do not consider them necessary for spiritual fulfillment. Serene awareness of one's unity with Nature and Er is the goal. This awareness manifests naturally in a virtuous life.

The Eran religion welcomes all seekers of truth and universal understanding. It integrates scientific advancement and social progress into its dynamic conception of the Divine.
