Hestia is a mid-sized town of roughly 4-5000 people. It sits on the north side of [[./The-Dunwold|The Dunwold]], and is the largest settlement, other than Astryth (which dwarfs it), in the Lower Kypar region. 

The main points of interest are:

1. The Trade Ward: The center of commerce for Hestia, the Trade Ward is where all goods passing through the Dunwold come, and where a significant amount of trade and barter is conducted. It is an ideal place to collect gossip, buy items both mundane and wonderous, and in general people watch. 
2. The Temple of Er: The central temple of Er for Hestia and the surrounding countryside. It is of a elegant, if simple, build, and is one of the oldest Eran temples in Vardoun. 
3. Wold Ward: Sitting at the border to the Dunwold, this ward is slightly run-down, but is where many a tradesman might be found, or perhaps a guide through the Wold. 
4. Comm's Way: The "main street" of Hestia -- several major businesses are located here, including Klik'tik's *Wares and Wonders* and the Crooked Tree Inn and Tavern.
