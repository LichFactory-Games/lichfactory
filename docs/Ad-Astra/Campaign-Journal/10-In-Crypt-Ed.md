We made it into the Gala. Though feeling a bit out of place we mingled and smiled. The artifacts on display in the ballroom were very interesting. There was an enormous tusk or tooth (it was difficult to tell), and some sort of shiny black rock with what looked a big lizard claw but blown up to comical size, imprinted in it. 

Stigs and Gwen both had respective chats with Saros and Zerrenia. It seems there is some sort of power struggle going on now amongst the followers of Hodos. The was much talk of "the way" and who was best suited to take others on the path. Zerrenia was haughty but also seemingly sad. Saros just seemed a bit of a lunatic. 

We explored a bit further and discovered the master study at the rear of the house. Gwen made herself invisible while Stigs unlocked the door so she could sneak in. It helped that we had arranged the previous day for a distraction to occur. Amidst the clamor of breaking dishes and glasses Gwen managed to sneak into and inspect the study. She took a timepiece and some papers from the desk, and discovered a signet ring and some sort of phrase etched into the locked drawer. These proved to be just what we needed to get into the crypt! 

Meanwhile Stigs, impersonating a member of the House staff, was drafted into cleaning up and waiting on folks. Fortunately, this also allowed him to get a sense of the layout of the basement, should they need to escape that way. Karel and Ryalith mostly hung back and looked on at the chaos. 

We had arranged for a further distraction to cover our movement from the house to the crypt. While a mob of angry professors yelled at the front entrance, we took our leave of the house through a side door and made our way to the crypt. Once there Karel bravely stepped forward wearing the signet ring and said the passphrase. It seemed to work! The statute -- an enormous 12 foot figure made of stone -- stood impassively at the gate into the crypt. Now to find the book and get out of here!
