## Let's Get This Party Started!

After our agreement with Velik was made, we each set off on our individual tasks. Gwen made her way to the Library of Xoth for research, Ryalith and Karel enjoyed the city's lively atmosphere through carousing, and Gloopwing disappeared on her enigmatic errands.

Meanwhile, Stigs met with his boss and mentor, Magnus Halvorsen. In a gruff manner, Magnus acknowledged Stigs's work, allowing him to take sick leave for the upcoming week. However, he sternly reminded Stigs to be prepared for their trip back to Eryth in the next ten days. Magnus seemed somewhat concerned about Stigs, but would never openly say anything. 

The following morning, a day before the gala, we woke up to find a note from Crox. He had arranged a dressing appointment for us at Regina's Ravishing Regalia, one of the city's most exclusive clothiers. Our experience there was like a scene from a tale of high society, complete with a montage of us trying on various elegant outfits. Gwen in particular couldn't resist trying to dance with everyone as she found exactly the dress she wanted and twirled up and down the room with it. 

After our transformation at Regina's, we realized someone had slipped the *Clavis Astralis*, the key we needed for the next phase of our plan, into Ryalith's coat, along with another note from (we assume) Velik. With this in hand, we were ready to attend the gala at House Tethys. Our mission, to find the passphrase the family uses to enter the crypt without being attacked by its stone guardian. Dressed in our new finery and armed with this knowledge, we prepared to enter the house of Ptolomus Tethys and his family. Party on!
