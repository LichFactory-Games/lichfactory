## Into the Catacombs

Our descent into the catacombs beneath Hestia was marked by a palpable sense of dread. It began with Prince Slithy and Gloopwing leading the descent into a gaping hole that led to the dark tunnels below. Slithy, attached to a rope, spotted signs of a struggle, including fresh blood, while Gloopwing, utilizing her unique ooze abilities, stealthily navigated the depths, leading us to a sinister door marked with interlocking circles reminiscent of the Opener, Hodos.

Ryalith's attempt to join us was almost catastrophic as she slipped and clanged against the well's walls, creating a gong-like sound that echoed ominously through the tunnels. Stigs, maintaining his composure, followed more cautiously, while Gwen, quick and agile, made it down effortlessly.

The discovery of blood at various points heightened our tension. Gwen's keen observation revealed the freshness of the blood and its ominous presence on a stone bowl by the door. Stigs' recognition of the symbol on the door as an old rendition of the "Opener" was crucial in our understanding of the situation. Ryalith's bold action of smearing her blood on the bowl unlocked the door, leading us further into the unknown.

The hallway lined with unsettling skeletal remains was a grim testament to the horrors that had transpired. Stigs' use of a mage hand to check for traps revealed more about the gruesome fate of the skeletons, some with gouges in their eye sockets. Gloopwing's peculiar interaction with one such skeleton revealed a connection to glowing green shards, reminiscent of the nightmares that haunted us.

Our journey led us to a room with an altar, where Gwen's inspection of a torn acolyte's fabric and Gloopwing's investigation of the congealed blood in the bowl added layers to the mystery. The encounter with a ghoul in a pit further into the tunnels indicated how precarious the ground was that we tread. 

In a mausoleum, we uncovered ancient coins and a vial of enigmatic smoke, which Gwen safeguarded. These discoveries, along with pagan symbols on the statues, suggested a connection to ancient and forgotten rituals.

In the central chamber, the true horror unfolded. The once-revered Hierophant was leading a ritual amidst undead creatures. Ryalith, without hesitation, engaged the nearest ghoul, showcasing her fighting prowess. Meanwhile, Gloopwing cleverly used her form to manipulate the environment, creating distractions and openings for attacks. By far the most effective form of attack against the undead was grappling them and throwing them in nearby pits, which Gloopwing and Ryalith both used to their advantage time and again. 

Gwen's resourcefulness shone as she utilized the mysterious vial found earlier (unfortunately it did nothing…), and created an echo of herself to confuse our foes. Stigs’ new magic crossbow proved deadly against the skeletal foes, his shots finding their mark with lethal precision.

The climax of our encounter saw Ryalith bravely grapple the Hierophant, subduing him with sheer determination. Gloopwing, in a moment of quick thinking, threw holy water at the Runeskull, significantly weakening our enemies. Gwen's daring move to grab the skull and use her Ray of Sickness spell was pivotal in turning the tide of the battle. Gwen bent space to take her to safety and then destroyed the runeskull by smashing at the bottom of the pit in which various ghouls had been thrown. 

The destruction of the Runeskull, a central artifact in the Hierophant's rituals, marked a significant victory for us. However, the Hierophant's cryptic words and

After a grueling fight, we emerged victorious but not unscathed. The revelations of the Hierophant's betrayal and the insidious influence of the Opener cult left us with a heavy burden. Our return to the surface brought a mixture of relief and unease, as the rewards from the temple seemed trivial compared to the dark truths we had uncovered. Our journey through the catacombs of Hestia was a testament to our resilience, teamwork, and the ever-present shadow of the unknown that looms over our adventures.
