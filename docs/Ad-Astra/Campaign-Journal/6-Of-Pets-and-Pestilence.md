## Of Pets and Pestilence

We accepted Crox's job offer and descended into the sewers, making our way through the undercity market. There, we rescued a mistreated baby Griffon, offering it a safer haven. Our inquiries revealed that Crox's crew had traversed this area about a day earlier. The mere mention of "Velik" by Gwen, while purchasing meat from a butcher, caused a stir of fear, prompting the butcher to quickly vacate the premises.

Our session ended with us investigating a maggot-infested body, which we identified as belonging to one of Crox's crew. After eliminating the maggots, we found a map on the body, indicating House Tethys as their intended destination.
