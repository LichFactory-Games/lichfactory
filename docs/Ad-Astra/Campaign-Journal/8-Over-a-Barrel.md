## Over a Barrel 

We escorted Savran to The Blackened Barrel, an unsigned and innocuous tavern a few blocks off the busy streets of the Commercium. Though the bar didn't seem open, Savran gave a special knock at one of the doors and was recognized and welcomed inside by "Jimmy", the bartender. The bar itself was low-lit, with sumptuous furniture and lots of nooks and crannies where a private conversation might be had. 

We all arranged ourselves at the bar while Jimmy plied us with the locally distilled whiskey for which the bar is (apparently) well-known. After some pleasantries we settled into an uneasy quiet, until we heard a voice behind us give a greeting. We were introduced to the owner -- Velik Nox -- whose fey appearance and friendly (if someone formally stilted) demeanor belied something much more sinister. Velik paid us for returning Savran and the "key" (such as it was -- the object itself seemed unlike any key we had ever seen). Indeed -- he overpaid by 100 GP. Velik also proposed that we complete another job -- retrieving a book ensconsed in the Tethys house crypt. 

Apparently Crox's Crew had intended to retrieve the book but had run into unexpected trouble in the form of a guardian statue. The statue badly injured them and then the Otyugh living below the House finished them off. We are now tasked with getting into House Tethys during their biennial Gala, figuring out the passphrase that might allow us safe passage by the guardian statue, and then procuring the book from the Crypt. When we safely hand over the book to Velik, we will receive 2000 GP. 

After leaving the Barrel we stopped in a nearby part to talk over these events. Gwen had learned that Velik is some sort of fey creature, likely a Hexblood with relations to one or more hags. Gwen is convinced that our path to becoming great heroes lies in double-crossing Velik. Not everyone agreed. We decided to break mid-day, with Karel and Ryalith carousing throughout the city, Stigs and Gwen procuring magic components and spells, and Gloopwing wandering off to some unknown end. Gwen intends to do some research at the Library of Xoth in Ward Sophos on the arcane books we've encounterd, and Stigs hopes to catch up with his mentor and check in with House Orosen before he gets in trouble.
