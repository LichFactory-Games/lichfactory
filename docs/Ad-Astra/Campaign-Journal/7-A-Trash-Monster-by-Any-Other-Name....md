## A Trash Monster by Any Other Nameâ€¦

Gwen's keen observation led us to a dried blood trail from the maggot-infested corpse. This path took us to a hidden passage in the sewer, veiled by vines. Gloopwing's exploration revealed a series of unusual chambers, distinct from the sewer's architecture, with a canal of iridescent, bioluminescent water.

As we ventured into the chamber, Gloopwing and Stigs led the way through the canal. Gloopwing had a near-miss, slipping and being pulled towards a culvert. Thanks to the timely intervention of Gwen (via her familiar, Prince Slithy) Gloopwing was teleported to safety.

The canal transit was treacherous for all, with Karel and Gwen (perched on Karel's shoulders) also struggling against the slippery terrain. Yet, our determination saw us through to the next chamber, where Gwen's curiosity ultimately led her to a shocking sight: the unconscious Savran Vishkal and a massive, multi-tentacled Otyugh with a transparent chitinous shell.

The battle that ensued tested our mettle. Gwen's thunder wave assaults, Stigs's timely healing, and Karel's fierce attacks played pivotal roles. Our tactical prowess shone as we strategically flanked the creature. The Otyugh's robustness and toxic breath were daunting, yet our persistence paid off. After enduring its brutal attacks and managing to free Gloopwing and an unconscious Ryalith from its grasp, it was Gwen who delivered the final, crushing thunder wave, reducing the beast to a heap of purple ruins.

In the aftermath, Savran revealed his possession of a key, cryptically referred to as "the key to the city." He proposed a shortcut back to our starting point in the undercity and offered to lead us to Crox at the Blackened Barrel. The session concluded with an amusing yet necessary request from Savran for Karel to employ his prestidigitation spell for some much-needed fresh attire for the group.
