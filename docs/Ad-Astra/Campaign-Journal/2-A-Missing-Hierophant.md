## A Missing Hierophant 

After enduring the treacherous paths of The Dunwold, we found solace in the town of Hestia. A quaint town, Hestia thrives on trade, timber, and farming, serving as a crucial stop for travelers heading to the coast. We've been staying at the Crooked Tree Inn, but our nights have been anything but peaceful. Haunting nightmares of dark rituals and green flaming skulls have plagued us, depicting a robed figure performing unspeakable acts before a monstrous skull.

The morning after our most troubled sleep yet, as we gathered downstairs for breakfast, an unusual sight caught our attention. Valen Karnakis, a young seeker from the Temple of Er, was desperately seeking help. His eyes, filled with anxiety, lit up with hope as he approached us. He spoke of Hierophant Thanatis Anelisi's disappearance and the temple's offer of 100 gold pieces and a boon for assistance in finding him. The urgency in Valen's voice was palpable.

Our decision to help was soon put to the test. The temple, a place we thought a refuge, became a battleground. An undead horde, seeking victims for nefarious purposes, stormed the temple. The chaos was intense, but we managed to fend off the attack, though not without casualties among the acolytes. Four were kidnapped. 

The aftermath left us with more questions than answers. Tabath, an acolyte at the temple, hinted at a deeper mystery involving the catacombs beneath and the Runeskull. Our journey, it seems, is taking a turn towards the arcane and the unknown. The more we uncover, the more we realize that Hestia harbors secrets far beyond its simple appearance. And so, our adventure continues, driven by both a need for gold and a growing curiosity about the dark undercurrents flowing beneath Hestia's serene surface.
