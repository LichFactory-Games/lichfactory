## Death in the Dunwold 

We, the travelers, ventured through the Dunwold, each drawn by our own reasons towards the great city of Astryth, one of the twin cities of the Dyarchy. Guided by Celin Lothvari, our journey took an unsettling turn on the second night in the Wold.

Initially, we shared rumors ofthe ill-fated travelers, loggers, and hunters in the Wold, but our conversation was abruptly interrupted by a herd of terrified Elk storming through our camp. While we scrambled to safety, Ryalith impressively vaulted onto one of the Elk, disappearing into the dark forest.

In the aftermath, we decided to split up and investigate the cause of the Elk's terror. Our exploration was cut short when one of our groups was suddenly ambushed by the Night Hunter, a shadowy figure. As we fought splintered shadows peeled off from the Night Hunter and attacked as well. The fight was fierce, with Stigs sustaining serious injuries. However, our collective strength prevailed. Karel, focusing his might, dealt the final, devastating blow with his prosthetic arm, defeating the Night Hunter and its splintered shadows. This encounter left us shaken but resolved, as we continued our journey towards Astryth, wary of the dangers hidden within the shadows of the Dunwold.
