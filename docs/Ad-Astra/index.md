In *Ad Astra* the characters seek to learn the truth about various dark forces that are moving against the land and sowing chaos in the Dyarchy. This truth will change the world and set the characters on a journey to the stars.

# Welcome to Ermis

Ermis, the hollow planet. Its inhabitants dwell concealed in the interior, living under the light of the *Strom*, a forever-raging electrostatic tempest. Ermis's two great cities, Eryth and Astryth, flank the twin towers of the Spar, colossal mesas piercing up through the Strom from opposing ends of Ermis. The floating city of Omerth hovers between them at Ermis's hollow center. Together these cities constitute the Dyarchy, a theocracy ruled by the Dyad (the Two-Who-Are-One). Adventurers must navigate the dangers of the Dyarchy,  the intrigues of its great houses, and the challenges of other factions, such as the mechanically-minded Haimin and the enigmatic Fair Folk.

To its denizens, Ermis is everything. They lack even the *concept* of an "outside" to Ermis. But what if intrepid explorers uncovered the astonishing truth that Ermis is merely one small part of a vast cosmic tapestry? Or that its inhabitants originate from the wild voids between distant stars? Journey from the hollows of Ermis to the stars beyond. Ancient secrets and eldritch powers converge to determine Ermis's future. Can our heroes stop what's coming? 

## Truths of Ermis

1. **Harmony of Magic & Tech**: Magic and technology (mechanical & steam-powered) coexist, yielding possibilities both wondrous and terrible.  
2. **Unsuspecting Inhabitants**: No one on Ermis is aware that they live inside a planet, or that there a great cosmos beyond.  
3. **Cold War Intrigue**: Eryth and Astryth, twin cities of the Spar, are centers of intrigue and opportunity. They are the seats of the Great Houses, which are locked in an uneasy peace, overseen by the Dyarchy and the forces of the Hegemonikon.
4. **Beyond the Twin Cities**: The realm of Haem to the northeast boasts mechanical marvels, while the western Fair Wildes remain an enigma to all but the Fair Folk themselves. And immediately north lies the great Kyper Desert, home of the nomadic Sil. 
5. **Occult Mysticism**: The enigmatic **Cult of Hodos** seeks a way to transcend the confines of Ermis.
6. **Stranger Things**: Odd events and even odder creatures have appeared, which many say are coming from deep within the earth. Officials disavow these events, but the presence of some unknown and sinister force is becoming undeniable. 

## Factions & Patrons

If you like, choose a potential patron or faction whose interests you serve (or work against!):

1. **The Dyarchy**: Upholders of order, entrusted with maintaining equilibrium in Ermis, and control over the Great Houses.
2. **The Great Houses**: Aristocratic families (Tethys, Xeryth, Hyperion, Valtor, Orosen) engaged in an endless power struggle. 
3. **The Arkanum**: Guardians of technomancy, anchoring the economic foundation of the Spar cities.
4. **Cult of Hodos**: Devoted seekers of Hodos, Opener of the Way, unlocking cosmic secrets.

## Character Creation

Shape your character using these guidelines:

- **Ability Scores**: Roll **4d6** and drop the lowest. Do this six times. if none of your scores are 14 or higher, or if the set has **two or more** scores of 8 or under you may roll a new set of six.
- **Allowed Sources**:  All classes from the 2014 PHB and TCE are allowed. If you wish to play a **Warlock** please talk with me first.   Other sources are negotiable. 
- **Ancestry/Lineage**: Ermis lacks many standard D&D ancestries/lineages. You **cannot** play a Dwarf, Dragonborn, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, or Tiefling. **Instead**, the following are available for play on Ermis:  (lineages) Dhampir, Hexblood, Reborn; (ancestries) Harendon, Human, Loxodon, Plasmoid, Thri-Kreen, and Vedalken.
- **New Ancestries**: Autons: living mechanical constructs;  Doloi: a kind of goblinoid; The Faeir: enigmatic and aloof fey humanoids; Haemin: humanoids small of stature but big in their ideas (as if dwarves, halflings, and gnomes were just one race…).
- **Racial Bonuses**: When choosing a race, racial ability bonuses can be applied to **any** ability, with a maximum of +2 to any single ability.
- **New Classes & Subclasses**: Psion (psychic powers,  three subclasses), Pugilist (master of hand-to-hand combat,  seven subclasses); Kinemancer; Orimancer (Wizard); Power Domain (Cleric); Tinkerer (Rogue). 

## Safety Tools

The adventure features themes of the absurd, darkness, cosmic horror, body horror, and madness. Below are some **starting** lines and veils. We can discuss making changes or additions during the first session (i.e. "session 0") and as the game progresses. 

- **Lines**: This game will not contain physical violence towards children, unwanted sexual contact, gratuitous animal abuse, party-initiated torture.
- **Veils**: Cannibalism, consensual sex, and enemy-initiated torture will be "veiled" off-screen. If at any time you don't feel comfortable with the content or direction of the game, say "pause for a second" and we will stop the game and address your concerns.
