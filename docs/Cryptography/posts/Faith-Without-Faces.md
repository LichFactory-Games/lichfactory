In honor of the currently convened papal conclave, and as part of [Prismatic Wasteland's Emergency Conclave Bandwagon](https://prismaticweekly.substack.com/p/emergency-bandwagon-conclave-edition), I though I might sketch out an alternative take to gods and religion in fantasy games. If you ever wondered whether Spinoza, Hegel, or Schopenhaur might be relevant to your RPG experience, this one's for you (I promise this will be interesting even if you have no idea who those people are!).

## People In The Sky 

Most approaches to gods in fantasy games treat them as something like people who live in the sky (or under the earth) and spectate on the actions of us mere mortals. These gods are very much people -- they have thoughts, desires, hopes, and perhaps even dreams. They make choices, and they may be held accountable for those choices. As with celebrities, the gods, they're just like us!

This is a totally fine way to think about gods in an RPG -- it's been the go to conception since the start of the hobby. A "cleric" or "priest" is just the name of a mortal who entreats one of these powerful people for aid, favor, magic, etc. The relationship between cleric and deity is essentially that of patron and beneficiary. 

But what if deities weren't people at all? Here I don't mean, what if they weren't human, or some such. I mean, what if they weren't *people* -- no thoughts, hopes, desires, dreams, etc.? 

"Well that doesn't sound very fun", you might be thinking. Indeed, if deities aren't people, then what are they -- things? It's all well and good to worship a rock, tree, or physical structure, and I'm sure someone, somewhere, has made an amazing game out of doing so. But it doesn't seem particularly fit for a fantasy RPG. However, there are alternatives to treating deities as, if not persons, things. I want to look at two -- the divine as force, and the divine as being itself. Both of these are drawn from historical sources, and both could be lots of fun in an RPG. 


## The Divine As Force

The Stoic philosopher Chrysippus (279-206 BCE) construed the world as governed by a kind of law or principle -- "logos" (λόγος). Unlike the sky-dwelling gods who observe and meddle in mortal affairs through whim and fancy, the logos permeates everything as a cosmic intelligence—a rational fire flowing through all existence that orders the universe according to perfect mathematical patterns. This divine principle isn't something you petition or bargain with—it has no desires or emotions to appeal to—but rather represents the inherent rational structure that both creates and sustains reality itself.

### Logos and the Law vs. Chaos Axis

The Stoic concept of logos as a cosmic ordering principle bears striking similarities to how Gary Gygax conceptualized the Law-Chaos alignment axis in early Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. While the Stoics saw logos as an impersonal divine force maintaining cosmic order, Gygax translated this philosophical concept into a gamified cosmic struggle.

In AD&D, Law represents not just societal rules but a fundamental cosmic principle of order, structure, and predictability—much like the Stoic logos. Just as logos provides rational structure to the universe without personality or desire, "Law" in Gygax's cosmology functions as an impersonal force maintaining stability and pattern throughout the multiverse. Neither good nor evil inherently, Law simply represents the principle that reality should follow consistent, predictable patterns.

Chaos (χάος), its cosmic opposite, embodies not just randomness but *active resistance* to imposed structure—the entropy that logos continuously works against. This cosmological interpretation elevates the Law-Chaos axis beyond mere human morality into fundamental forces shaping reality itself, and gives clerics of Law a connection not to personified sky-beings but to an impersonal cosmic principle that maintains order in the face of entropic dissolution and ultimately, annihilation.

Gygax, drawing from influences like Michael Moorcock's *Eternal Champion* series and Poul Anderson's *Three Hearts and Three Lions* (which featured Law-Chaos as cosmic forces), created a fantasy framework where clerics could serve abstract principles rather than personified deities—a framework compatible (whether intentionally or not) with Stoic conceptions of logos as divine force rather than divine person.

### Clerics of Cosmic Forces

In a game where clerics or priests (or whatever) serve impersonal cosmic forces rather than gods, their relationship with divine power fundamentally transforms. Instead of petitioning sky-people, these clerics attune themselves directly to universal principles like Law/Logos or Chaos.

There are many possibilities for play here. For example, a cleric of Law might function as a living conduit for cosmic order. Their magical abilities wouldn't come from a deity's *favor* but from their philosophical alignment with and embodiment of fundamental universal patterns. Through disciplined practice, meditation, and rituals that reinforce order, such a cleric would draw power directly from the logos itself.

In this picture, spellcasting becomes manifestation of universal principles—healing represents restoring proper order to a body, while protective magic imposes structured barriers against chaotic elements. Religious orders would function more as philosophical schools teaching deeper understanding of cosmic principles rather than churches worshipping personified beings. If this sounds a bit like planescape, you're on the right track. But planescape still personifies its deities and powers. What I'm emphasizing here is that we needn't do so to get a mechanically interesting character suitable for role-play. 

Character development on this view could easily be digetically explained as part of the internal journey of the cleric toward greater coherence with universal forces. Power increases as understanding deepens, not as one gains divine favor. Crisis of faith becomes crisis of understanding or alignment with these principles. A case of the cosmic yips could spell the end of one's clerical powers. 

This approach creates a more philosophical form of divine magic where clerics become living embodiments of the fundamental forces shaping reality itself.

## Divinity As Being

While the Stoics conceived of divinity as an impersonal ordering force, another tradition takes this de-personalization even further. Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) radically proposed that God is not separate from the universe at all—God simply *is* the universe in its totality. This conception, often called "pantheism," identifies God with Nature itself (his famous formula: *Deus sive Natura*—"God, or Nature").

For Spinoza, divinity isn't a being among beings or even a force that permeates beings; rather, divinity is *Being itself*—fundamental reality manifesting in an infinite variety of form and matter. 

So does this mean we, mere mortals, are God? Well, yes and no. We are all *modes* of God, which means that each of us, and each rock and pebble, table and chair, bird and bee, are all ways of God's existing. A mode is something that exists only because something else exists that "has" the mode as a property. A perfect example is a fist. Your fist isn't a basic substance that exists on its own—it only exists when your hand is closed in a certain way. The fist isn't just a property like "redness" or "smoothness,"--we wouldn't say "my hand is fist" the way we might say "my hand is red"--but it's not a fundamental substance either. It's somewhere in between. 

When your hand opens, the fist disappears completely. This shows that a fist's existence depends entirely on your hand being arranged in a specific way. In this sense, while a fist isn't just a property (it can have properties itself, like being strong or clenched tightly), it exists only as a modification (a "mode") of something more fundamental. For Spinoza, modes are like this—real things that exist, but whose existence is completely dependent on the arrangement or state of something more fundamental (God, or Nature).

On this view then everything that exists is simply a mode or expression of this single divine substance. There is no transcendent deity pulling strings from beyond and petitioned through prayer; the universe itself, in its interconnected totality, *is* God.

This conception found different expressions in later philosophers. G.W.F. Hegel (1770-1831) developed a vision of the "Absolute Spirit" as a kind of cosmic consciousness that progressively realizes itself through history. In Hegel's system, divinity is Being that comes to know itself through the dialectical process of human history and thought. The divine is still impersonal, but unlike Spinoza's static notion of an unchanging and eternal Being, Hegel's Absolute is dynamic—evolving, developing, always becoming.

In stark contrast, Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) conceived of the foundation of reality as "Will"—a blind, purposeless *striving* that manifests itself in all things. This cosmic Will has no goal, no consciousness, no morality—it simply *is*, endlessly expressing itself through the suffering and striving of all beings. If Spinoza and Hegel represent lawful conceptions of Being-as-divinity, Schopenhauer offers us the chaotic counterpart.

### Clerics of Being

What would clerics look like in a game world where divinity is conceived as Being itself? Such clerics wouldn't petition transcendent deities or even align with cosmic forces—they would participate in and manifest the fundamental nature of reality itself.

A cleric of Spinoza's God-as-Nature would seek to understand the immutable laws governing all existence, and in this way understand themselves. Their power would derive from recognizing the inherent divinity in all things and the fundamental interconnection of all phenomena. Their magic might focus on revealing hidden connections, manipulating natural laws, or achieving heightened states of understanding that transcend ordinary perception. In a rough analogy between classes in D&D, this is to think of a cleric as something more like a monk. 

Hegelian clerics would be more historically oriented, seeing themselves as agents of the Absolute Spirit's self-realization. There's a lot of room for inspiration here. Perhaps clerical powers would wax and wane with historical tides, growing stronger at particularly dynamic moments of history—revolutions, paradigm shifts, cultural transformations. Their magic might involve manipulating contradictions, accelerating historical processes, or glimpsing future stages of development.

Schopenhauerian priests would draw power from acknowledging the fundamental striving that underlies all existence. Their magic might involve channeling the raw energy of Will itself, temporarily suspending the endless cycle of desire and suffering, or even manipulating the representational nature of perceived reality. These clerics might even be nihilistic ascetics who gain power precisely by denying the Will that drives all things.

As with the clerics of cosmic forces, there is a lot of room for diegetical notions of advancement, in addition to the more traditional levels or tiers of play. In gameplay terms, clerics of Being might gain power not through prayer or alignment with cosmic forces, but through their understanding of the world and their place in it. Their spells could be conceptualized as temporary manipulations of the fundamental fabric of reality rather than granted boons. Crisis might come not from failing their deity but from losing their hard-won understanding of reality's true nature.

There can even be a kind of Lovecraftian element here. Traditional presentations of Lovecraftian cosmic horror depend on the protagonist realizing their insignificance, or that their actions or lives are meaningless. But an alternative notion of cosmic horror makes itself available when we start to think of reality as essentially one being of which each of us is a mere expression. The term "nihilism" was coined to describe what people took to be the commitments of such a philosophical picture. No freedom or responsibility, no possibility of eternal life, not even any morality -- just the eternal (or dynamic) expression of Being. Perhaps as the cleric more clearly realizes the nature of reality and their place in it, the more disturbed they become (or the more persected by others they become).[^1]

This approach transforms the cleric from divine intermediary to ontological explorer—one who draws power not from personified beings or even cosmic principles, but from the very nature of existence itself. Where the traditional cleric asks 'What does my god want?', and the cleric of cosmic force asks 'How are my actions aligned with cosmic principles?', the cleric of Being realizes the profound truth: 'I am already what I seek—my power comes not from serving reality, but from being it.
