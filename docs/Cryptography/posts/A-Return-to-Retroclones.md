While not everyone agrees as to what the OSR is, or even what "OSR" stands for, one feature that marks much of the OSR discourse is prevalence of "retroclones", which are games that have been designed or created to reproduce or at least riff on a game experience generated by rule sets and play culture of the "original" D&D products put out by TSR Games up through [AD&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_&_Dragons) (particularly 1e) and the "basic" D&D lines (particularly [Moldvay & Cook's B/X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision) and [Mentzer's BECMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1983_revision)).

With that in mind, today I want to think about why in the world I decided to write my own retroclone of the [D&D *Rules Cyclopedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Rules_Cyclopedia) -- *Swords & Sovereigns*.

## Meet the New Boss, Same as the Old Boss

There are a few questions one ought to have answers to before creating a new game system. The first has to be "why am I doing this?" -- there are so many amazing games out there already, it may initially seem foolish at best and narcissistic at worst to create yet another game system, especially one that emulates the world's oldest and most imitated fantasy RPG. Such "fantasy heartbreakers" are thick upon the ground, so why make another one? 

This was perhaps the easiest question for me to answer. 

I wanted to take what I thought of as the most "complete" version of D&D -- the BECMI/Rules Cyclopedia (RC) system -- and revise it with modern play and information design principles in mind. I felt like this might even be a project of interest to others, given that there is only one other RC retroclone out there -- [Dark Dungeons](https://www.nobleknight.com/P/2147547832/Dark-Dungeons?msclkid=a8907b2c01df1daa19c71328f5c41ea6&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Website%20-%20Dynamic&utm_term=nobleknight&utm_content=all%20web%20pages). *Dark Dungeons* is excellent, but it is unwieldy and overly verbose for table use. It is also extremely dense and I felt could benefit from a sparser, less crowded, information design. 

Thus was born *Swords & Sovereigns*.

The much more difficult set of questions to answer depends on what "revising with modern play and information design principles" really means. I decided I wanted to have the following features, concerning each of which I'll provide further comment in subsequent posts.

1. Class & ancestry are separate
2. Progression to level 20
3. “Roll high” resolution system (1d20 & 2d6)
4. Ascending Armor Class
5. Slot Encumbrance
6. Revised weapon mastery rules

For the remainder of this post, I want to talk briefly about why one might want to create a retroclone (or "hack") as opposed to a "new" system that might be inspired by older gameplay, but implements that gameplay by means of substantively different mechanics. These latter "NuSR" (New School Roleplaying) game systems, such as *Into the Odd*, *Cairn*, *Mothership*, and (arguably) *Shadowdark* have all been immensely successful and proved significant alternatives to the retroclone approach to older styles of play. 

## A Clone By Any Other Name 

The original retroclone was *OSRIC*, short for *Old School Reference and Index Compilation*, which is an effective recreation of the AD&D 1e ruleset in a different language (i.e. contemporary English as opposed to High Gygaxian). Its intent was to make available the rules to the original AD&D without violating copyright. And this was prior to WotC's rerelease of older rule sets in PDF or print-on-demand form, so such clones were more or less the only way to get these older games short of buying them on Ebay or other resellers. 

Despite the name though, most D&D retroclones aren't exactly *clones*, because they usually have various changes to the ruleset to "fix" perceived issues in the original rules. We can see this in the [long list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_retro-clones) of games providing alterations, major or minor, to their respective original rulesets. Games like *Labyrinth Lord*, *Basic Fantasy RPG*, *Swords and Wizardry*, and *Lamentations of the Flame Princess* all honor their source material while making tweaks like setting the level progression to 1-20, adding ascending armor class, separating class and ancestry, or changing skills from d100 rolls to d6 rolls. Given that precedent the moniker of "retroclone" seems clearly compatible with changing the ruleset in various ways. 

So what makes a retroclone with lots of "fixes" still a retroclone, as opposed to a new but "old-school" game (like *Shadowdark*)? Going out on a limb here I'd say that explicitly tying one's game to a specific ruleset, where deviations from that ruleset are minimized and intentional is going to be important. Whether something is a "clone" as opposed to a "hack" is harder to parse and I'm going to refrain from doing so here. 

My approach to writing *Swords & Sovereigns* has been to take the rulesets of BECMI and RC as my guiding stars, deviating from them only if I feel I have good reason (and especially if I read that the designers themselves regret writing a rule the way that they did). In subsequent posts I'm going to explain my thinking behind each of the major changes I list above. I also want to explore reasons for avoiding a *fully* unified resolution system, as is found in a game like *D&D 5e* or *Shadowdark*, in favor of a family of mutually supporting subsystems. That latter is probably worth its own post (or two).
