Creating adventures for your table is hard. That's why around [50% of players](https://slyflourish.com/facebook_surveys.html#2020adventures) end up using published adventures from WotC or other publishers. But as many of you know, often there is still a lot of work needing to be done to make the adventure fit the needs and style of your table. There's [good advice](https://slyflourish.com/using_published_adventures.html) out there on how to tailor such adventures, but here I want to suggest something different: instead of running a slightly tailored pre-published adventure, "riff" on it by pulling out a few things you like as ideas for *your own* adventure. This is something that I think lots of folks do, but which I think could be explained better for others, and that's what I'll try and do here.

## Setting Constraints 

As an example I'm going to use the first adventure I ran in my current 5e campaign. This campaign takes place in a campaign setting I've created, so right off I knew I had a few important constraints: 

- 1st level adventure
- Wilderness setting 
- Creepy/horror vibe
- Some explanation of why the PCs might gather together

The arc of the campaign requires the PCs to go to the largest city on the continent and do a bunch of things there, but I didn't necessarily want to start the PCs in the city. So I thought, why not have them traveling to the city, and have them encounter something along the way? Since the campaign arc involves creeping dread and cosmic horror elements, I wanted something compatible with that theme. 

Of course, I could have just tried to work up something myself. But I had been spending a lot of time on the campaign setting itself and world-building and was hoping to save myself some time. I also had only limited experience running a 5e game and wanted a little bit of hand-holding. In this sort of situation riffing on an adventure seems like the perfect thing. 

## Choosing an adventure 

After a little bit of web-searching, I settled on the 5e adventure "[The Night Hunter](https://adventurelookup.com/adventures/the-night-hunter)" from [Arcane Library](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com). It was first level, was set in the woods, had a creepy/horror vibe (it is a riff on the "slasher in the woods" trope), and Kelsey Dionne, the writer, was known for her design sense and for writing good material.

Here's the basic [scenario structure](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/15126/roleplaying-games/game-structures), which is also really well laid-out on the page:

> At the start of the adventure, the characters set up camp during their travels, not realizing they are in the Night Hunterâ€™s territory. The Night Hunter chooses the PCs as its new victims. It spends the night harrying them from the darkness around their camp, becoming more audacious with its attacks until a final confrontation.

There are five events provided: 

1. The Howling -- while setting up camp there is a consistent howling sound that gets closer and closer. 
2. The Owl -- a loud crash in the woods turns out to be an owl hunting its prey. 
3. It Strikes -- The Night Hunter causes a herd of animals to run through the camp.  
4. A Cry for Help -- The Night Hunter pretends to be someone in distress out in the dark woods. 
5. The Butchery -- The Night Hunter, no longer hiding, strikes!

I love the mounting tension of the events. I also really like that though the structure is linear (each event happens about an hour after the previous one), the events themselves are quite open-ended, allowing a lot of flexibility in play. So we see here two important elements of why *The Night Hunter* is a great adventure to riff on: (i) open-ended and event-based structure that (ii) is linear but not "gated", in the sense that it's not necessary to have passed through a previous stage to get to the next and, except perhaps for the final event, one could even run them in reverse. 

## Same Question, Different Answer

In designing an adventure, you always want to be able to answer the classic questions of "who, what, when, where, and why" (you could add "how" to this list if you like), the answers to which constitute the adventure. *The Night Hunter* already answers these questions for us, but maybe we want different answers.

Here's what I ended up doing. Let's start with the *where* -- The Dunwold -- an enormous fey wood that stands between the southern coast and the city of Astryth. But *why* would the PCs go through it? And since this is the first adventure in the campaign, the answer also needs to include some explanation of why the PCs get together in the first place. In this case, during our [session 0](https://slyflourish.com/running_session_zeros.html) I have each player think of a reason why their character might need to travel from one of the southern coastal towns to the "big city" of Astryth. Since the Dunwold is between the coast and Astryth, this means the PCs all need to get through the Dunwold. 

Turning to the *who*, we've already dealt with the PCs by answering why they are all coming together (i.e. to journey to Astryth). Since I knew I would have five players I also knew I wanted to change up the big bad. In the original adventure the big bad is a cursed humanoid who is acting like they're out of a slasher film. In my case I wanted the big bad to be more of a *force* -- a personification of malign forces that have been creeping into the Dunwold over the last few months. I wanted less of a "Night Hunter" and more of the *night hunting*. 

The original Night Hunter has AC 13 and 39 HP, with 2 attacks at +7 for 7 damage each. While the damage per round is perfect for a first level party, I bumped up my night creature's HP by 25 to give it more durability (I could alternatively have upped the AC to 15 or 16). Also, since the Hunter only gets two attacks to the player's five I wanted to beef up its action economy. I did this by having it start to "shatter" once it had lost 30% of it HP into shade-like creatures with 3-5 HP, a necrotic attack, and a fear aura. It would split off more and more of these shades as it got closer to being destroyed, which should help ensure that the PCs don't just stand and beat it into the ground in 1-2 turns. 

So much for the big bad. I also added a guide, with whom the PCs each individually met in order to help shepherd them through the forest. This fit well with the *why* of the adventure -- the PCs all need to go to Astryth, and they go *together* because the guide is leading them all, and wanted to wait for the trip until he had enough people to be worth his while. Moreover, this sort of "companion NPC" is particularly useful in the early stages of a campaign, as he could provide info, add some comic relief upbeats if necessary, and even some backup in combat if absolutely necessary (though one has to be careful of undermining player agency here). 

We've got who, what, where, and why. We just need the *when*. The original adventure is supposed to take two hours of game time and cover a single night of in-world time. This seemed a bit short to me. I wanted three days of in-world time, with the tension mounting over three days rather than a few hours (I have also run this where the encounters are primarily in one night, but the travel is spread out over a few days, so there is a lot of flex here). With the longer time-span it is easier to slowly introduce the creeping dread of the forest, the eerie silence as the group travels into the heart of the forest, and the increasing frequency of odd occurrences that accompany their travels. At the end of the second night the guide disappears. I leave it ambiguous as to what exactly happened to the guide. Maybe he went investigating, maybe the night came for him. One of the many advantages of leaving it ambiguous, besides increasing the tension of the scenario, is that if the PCs need rescuing later it is easy to have the guide show back up. And then finally, on the eve of the third day of travel, the night attacks! 

Assuming the PCs survive, the aftermath might include some hooks for their next bit of travel, which in my case was to the town of Hestia, bordering the northern edge of the Dunwold. I doled out a bit of treasure in the form of a grateful guide, whom the players saved (one could see this having gone a variety of other ways). But not *too* much treasure. The real reward, as any fan of a horror movie can tell you, is surviving the night.

## Keep Riffing

To review, we started with some constraints or conditions on what we needed from an adventure. This helped with figuring out how we might search for and evaluate a published adventure as suitable. We then picked an adventure on the basis of it's meeting our constraints, and its having a flexible and open-ended scenario structure that while linear wasn't "gated". Finally, we asked a bunch of questions -- the who, what, when, where, and why -- of the adventure, and gave answers that were fairly different from the original, but inspired by its skeleton. 

So this sort of riffing saved me a bunch of time and gave me confidence for the adventure, but in the end I had something that was very specific to my campaign world and the particular players at my table. This tends to be my general approach to published adventures. I don't run them, I use them as a kind of "inspiration vault" from which to draw and build upon.
