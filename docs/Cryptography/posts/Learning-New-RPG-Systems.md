One of my new year's resolutions was to play more and different games in 2024. And I'm lucky to be part of an online community of folks who also have interests in trying lots of different games. In fact, I have been able to run several different game systems in 2024 and have played in several other campaigns. I'm hoping for more in 2025! In light of all this, I thought it might be worthwhile to reflect on what sorts of things one might think about in learning a new system, at least to the point of having basic practical facility with it.

Learning a new RPG system can be daunting, both for the GM and players. There are a lot of RPGs in which system mastery is heavily rewarded, so once one has gotten to that point it might be hard to get motivated to leave the system and start from scratch in a different one. And if one is just a casual gamer, then learning a new system is even more daunting -- if you barely know the rules for the game you're currently playing it might seem demoralizing to think you'll be thrown into the deep end in a new system. 

Three things to think about when running or playing a new game: (wish I had a good acronym)

1. Core Mechanic 
2. Character Sheet 
3. Game Loop

Not all games have a single core mechanic. If you're used to d20 roll-high systems like 3,4, or 5e D&D you might get surprised if you go back to AD&D 1e and realize that there are several different subsystems, and that rolling high is sometimes good and sometimes bad. Then there are systems that are deeply unified, like GURPS, where (other than damage) you basically only ever roll 3d6 equal to or under a target number. 

The character sheet for a system can provide a lot of useful information about playing (I guess that is pretty obviousâ€¦) but it can also tell you a lot about what the game expects from you. Does the sheet have a lot of different information on it? Is most of the info combat-related? Answering yes or no to such questions tells you about what the areas of complexity or emphasis are in the game. 

The Game Loop describes the primary cycle of play - what players actually do repeatedly during a session. In an RPG it might be "explore, encounter, resolve, reward" while in a racing game it could be "qualify, race, upgrade, repeat." With the game loop it is especially important to be aware that what the rulebook *says* is the game loop and what it actually is *in play* may be subtly (or quite overtly) different. For example, 5e D&D explicitly articulates its game loop in terms of the "three pillars" of play -- exploration, social engagement, combat. But the majority of the game mechanics, character build, and general emphasis in adventures is towards combat.
