Welcome to *Cryptography*, my newly-minted blog on all things RPG-related. I'm hoping to post things on the process of writing adventures, as well as modifying pre-existing ones. I'm interested in all sorts of games, but expect to see a lot of D&D, GURPS, Mothership, and Savage Worlds, as these are all games I am playing or intend to play this year.

I was a gamer as a kid (40ish years ago) but fell out of it in my late teens. I came back to gaming during the pandemic, like lots of other folks, and found the RPG world to be significantly richer and more interesting than when I had last left it!

I've been lucky to play with some very good folks, as well as old friends, and I've been very pleased to find helpful voices in Discord communities (thanks especially to the Sly Flourish and Mastering Dungeons discords!) for various input and gaming advice. Here I'll be trying to discuss table-top role-playing in a more public-facing way than Discord allows. Whether any of these posts will be worth reading is another story entirely.
