For the game world I created for one of the D&D 5e campaigns I'm running I wanted to create (or "homebrew") some subclasses (and a new class, but that's another story) to make the campaign world feel a bit more special and different.

These days there are lots of great resources for getting started with homebrewing. Besides many many youtube videos, there are also the great discussions and links available from r/unearthedarcana -- the [Brewer's supplies](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/wiki/resources/) section is particularly useful. There are also great online resources for generating professional-looking material. Sites like [the homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com) and [GM Binder](https://www.gmbinder.com). But as nice as such platforms are, one shouldn't mistake a bit of homebrew that looks good from homebrew that works effectively in a campaign. Some homebrew material is irredeemably "broken" (though of course, if things are working well at your table then in the end that is really all that matters). 

It's much easier to start homebrewing by building a new subclass. Why? Because you have both the existing class and the other existing subclasses to work off of in terms of evaluating balance and what is appropriate to the subclass. 

## The Core Concept 

What do you need to make a subclass? First, you need a *concept*. In a way this is the most important thing, since it is going to drive the rest of your choices. Maybe the concept is very simple -- you just want a "revision" of some already existing subclass so that it includes your favorite feature or excludes one you dislike. It could also be quite complex -- maybe you want to take the class in a direction that is different from any of the other published subclasses (given the number of subclasses out there this is getting increasingly difficult). 

The *concept* distinguishes the subclass from all others. There should be (at least) *one cool thing* thing that makes it stand out from other options, while still being characteristically of the parent class. Consider, for example, the various Wizard subclasses. They each have some distinctive abilities suited to their school of magic while all being very recognizably *Wizards*. Not all published subclasses clearly satisfy these conditions. For example the [Aberrant Mind Sorcerer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1360-aberrant-mind-sorcerer-guide-features-pros-cons) doesn't clearly line up with the core concept of a sorcerer as a kind of "innate" spellcaster. Instead the aberrant sorcerer seems to have the core concept of a *Warlock* (there is some sort of "alien influence" that provides you with power), with the mechanics of a sorcerer (you have sorcery points and meta-magic). This doesn't mean that the subclass isn't fun to play! Just that conceptually it is somewhat *confused*. It ends up stepping on the toes of multiple subclasses across different classes, and for that reason loses the sort of specificity that aids in flavorful role-play. 

## Subclass Features 

Once you've got a core concept and it's "one cool thing", you then need to think of a set of features that best express that concept, and do so in a way that could be distributed over a series of level progressions as the character matures and gains power. There is no set amount in terms of features -- things are going to very between classes, types of classes, and between older and newer subclasses. But a good rule of thumb is five features that are flavorful in terms of how they express the core concept of the subclass, while also being different enough from what other classes/subclasses might offer. I think it is fine if there is *some* mechanical overlap with other subclasses, so long as the flavor of the feature is distinctive, but too much overlap and you risk failure in distinguishing your subclass from others. 

Ideally the features help express and develop the core concept and the cool thing that distinguishes the class. They should also complement and not conflict with the core feature(s) of the parent class. So, for example, the *Path of the Berserker* takes the core concept of *rage* that helps define the parent class *Barbarian* and develops and complements it in a particular way -- by turning up the intensity on the notion of rage in a very pure way. In that sense the *Path of the Berserker* subclass is *the* defining expression of a Barbarian. Similar things might be said for *Invocation* subclass of *Wizard* or the *Thief* subclass of the *Rogue*. 

## Distributing Subclass Features 

Once you've decided on a set of features definitive of your subclass, you need to think about how to distribute them in terms of level progression. The first thing to do is to look at the progression sequence of archetypes specified by the *parent class*. You'll find this in the class description presented in the *Player's Handbook* (or from wherever you're taking the class). For example, if you're making a subclass of the *Fighter* then you first want to look at how the class distributes its archetype features. In the case of the *Fighter* they are distributed at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. So if you have five features distinctive of your homebrewed subclass, they will be doled-out one at a time between levels 7 and 18. 

You also want to make sure that your homebrewed feature set coordinates well with the major class features. Sticking with the example of the *Fighter* class, you want to make sure that none of your feature set undermines the Fighting Style, Second Wind, Action Surge, Extra Attack, or Indomitable features that define the class. Indeed, whatever features one chooses for a fighter subclass, they should compliment and reinforce the class features. Of course, there are many ways that this might be done. Perhaps "reinforcement" here is via martial prowess and variety of attack. Perhaps it is via expression of a strong defense. 

Creating a good subclass is an art, not a science. But keeping the following steps in mind is sure to provide you with something that is fun to play. 

1. Articulate a core concept -- what "one cool thing" differentiates the subclass from others, while clearly expressing the core *parent class* concept? 
2. What are the subclass features and how are they distributed? 
	- How many features are there? 
	- How do they progress? 
	- How do they reinforce the core concept? 


In the next post I will talk about two subclasses that I have made, and what I think works, or just as importantly -- *doesn't work* -- about them.
