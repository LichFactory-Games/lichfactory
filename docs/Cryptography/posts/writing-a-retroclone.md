In a [previous post](A-Return-to-Retroclones.md), I talked about starting to write a retroclone of sorts -- *Swords & Sovereigns* -- of the old TSR-era *D&D Rules Cyclopedia*, which provides a great reference for the Mentzer BECMI edition of the classic game. I wanted to update some aspects of the game while keeping the core play loop and feel similar to the original.

<!-- more -->

I made the following changes:

1. Class & ancestry are separate
2. Progression to level 20
3. ‚ÄúRoll high‚Äù resolution system (1d20 & 2d6)
4. Ascending Armor Class
5. Slot Encumbrance
6. Revised weapon mastery rules


## Class & Ancestry

Possibly the most controversial of these is the first, the separation of class and ancestry (or "race"). While a popular feature of AD&D, the "classic" B/X and BE experience (also presented by many retroclones) is one that considers non-human ancestries to be their own classes. So why change that? There are many reasons, the most obvious of which is that the characteristics of a person that apply simply by virtue of being born shouldn't extend to what D&D represents using its notion of a "class." Classes are archetypes of a certain kind of life experience, of choices made and skills developed. Treating one's ancestry as akin to a class is a kind of category mistake, and fails to recognize what makes role-playing another person so interesting in the first place -- namely, the realization and expression of those experiences and choices that make a character who they are "today", in the world of the game. 

In addition to these more abstract considerations, there are clear mechanical issues to consider as well. The AD&D separation of class and ancestry was popular for a reason, namely it allowed a greater degree of flexibility and uniquieness in the character creation process. There were also aspects of the older system that made the various "demi-human" classes (particularly the elf) somewhat overpowered, and I wanted to avoid this. Each ancestry should present its own unique characteristics, but without making any particular choice "optimal" from a game rules perspective. I wanted to avoid the "character build optimization" mind-set without sacrificing the sort of flexibility and choice that most players enjoy. 


## Level Progression 

The next biggest change was to the leveling system. BECMI is (in)famous for its 1-36 (and then again with the Immortals) leveling, the heights of which may only have been organically reached by a handful of players. Why do we need 36 levels? The BECMI system envisioned a progression in power of characters from fragile but scrappy novices to masters of their domain (on the analogue of feudal lords or monarchs), and ultimately challengers of the gods themselves. I wanted to be sure to capture the progression from dungeon play to domain play. I was less concerned about the "immortals" rules concerning becoming a god. I also wanted to correct some criticisms of the BECMI system concerning the way in which classes (like the thief) get "nerfed" by the longer arc of level progression. So I condensed the level system to twenty levels (and was greatly influenced by [this blogpost](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/06/how-to-get-to-level-36-by-level-20.html) in doing so), and slightly reduced the power at the highest levels so that characters might still be powerful, while nevertheless failing to be entirely godlike. 

## "Roll High" Resolution 

One of the most significant changes to D&D once it was acquired by Wizards of the Coast and the third edition released, was the introduction of the "unified" d20 roll high resolution mechanic. Whenever a player was asked to roll a die to resolve some action for which success was uncertain, there was a single, unitary procedure -- roll a d20, add a modifier (if any) and compare the result to a target number. If the roll is equal to or greater than the target number the action is a success. For many this was a welcome change. Resolution no longer required knowing which of several dice were needed, or whether what was wanted was a high roll, as opposed to a low roll. Many found the "higher numbers are better" more psychologically satisfying and intuitive than a roll-under mechanic, and the unitary procedure for resolution was simpler and required less cognitive overhead for players and GMs alike. 

As the success of [Shadowdark RPG](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark) has shown, the d20 resolution system combines well with "old school" play. So why not bring this into my RC clone? Incorporating a roll high system into the RC ruleset is relatively straightforward, and is beneficial for all the reasons I enumerated above. However, I was less sold on the "unified resolution mechanic" being a single d20 roll. 

## Ascending Armor Class 

I'm not sure this needs much explanation -- THAC0 was never particularly compelling as a mechanic. And with the "roll high" resolution system, making armor class ascending was an easy choice. 

## Slot Encumbrance

The BECMI system uses a weight-based encumbrance system, which can be cumbersome üëÄ to track during gameplay. While I think resource management can be an important element of what makes old-school play so interesting, counting coins and calculating precise weights isn't the most exciting part of adventuring! I've replaced this with a slot-based encumbrance system (from a system written by Gavin Norman) that maintains the spirit of resource management while being much more straightforward to use.

The slot-based system focuses on significant items rather than exact weights. A character's movement rate is determined by the number of equipped and packed items they carry, with clear thresholds for movement penalties. This preserves the core resource management decisions of the original system‚Äîwhat to take and what to leave behind‚Äîwhile eliminating tedious arithmetic.

The key innovation here is distinguishing between "equipped" and "packed" items, creating tactical decisions about readiness versus capacity. A sword at your hip is more accessible but contributes more to encumbrance penalties than the same sword in your backpack.

This approach maintains the tension of resource management (a hallmark of old-school play) while making the system more intuitive and faster to use at the table. Players can quickly assess their current load and make meaningful decisions without interrupting the flow of exploration.

## Revised Weapon Mastery Rules

The weapon mastery system in the *Rules Cyclopedia* is one of its (and BECMI's) most distinctive features, offering characters (especially Fighters) increased proficiency and special abilities with specific weapons over time. However, the original system was quite complex, with numerous special effects and modifiers to track for each weapon at different mastery levels.

My revised weapon mastery rules maintain the core concept but simplify the execution. Rather than tracking separate effects for each weapon type, mastery now provides standardized benefits that scale with proficiency level. Masters gain increased accuracy, damage, and access to special combat maneuvers based on broad weapon categories (such as blades, bludgeons, polearms, and ranged weapons).

The progression is more streamlined, with fewer overall mastery levels but more meaningful improvements at each step. This approach provides several benefits:

1. Fighters and other martial classes still feel special in their weapon expertise
2. Players spend less time referencing weapon-specific rules
3. Combat remains tactically interesting without excessive complexity
4. Characters can more easily switch between similar weapons as needed
5. Special maneuvers provide combat options without overwhelming new players

These revised rules preserve the flavor and mechanical depth of weapon specialization while making the system more accessible and easier to remember during play.

## Conclusion

With these six major changes, *Swords & Sovereigns* aims to capture the essence of classic BECMI D&D while addressing some of its more cumbersome aspects. The game remains fundamentally recognizable to fans of the *Rules Cyclopedia*, but with modernized mechanics that reduce friction during play.

I believe these revisions strike a good balance between honoring the original game and incorporating lessons learned from decades of tabletop RPG design. The core experience‚Äîexploration, resource management, and fantasy adventure‚Äîremains intact, but hopefully with fewer mechanical obstacles to enjoying it.

I've just started running a campaign using the *Swords & Sovereigns* system. In future posts, I'll dive deeper into specific subsystems and share some playtest feedback. I'm particularly interested in how the revised weapon mastery rules interact with the combat system and whether the slot encumbrance approach maintains the resource management tension that makes old-school dungeon crawling so engaging.

What aspects of BECMI D&D do you think most deserve preservation in a modern retroclone? And which mechanics are you happy to leave behind? I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments.
