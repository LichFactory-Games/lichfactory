# Ermis Character Options

<!-- The planet Ermis and the history of Erspace put special constraints on, and options for, character creation. There are new ancestries for players to choose from, and restrictions on other ancestries. With regard to classes, there is a new class -- the Psion -- and several new subclasses, all of which are specific to the history, culture, politics, and environment of Ermis. -->

The planet Ermis and the history of Erspace put special constraints on, and options for, character creation. There are new ancestries/races for players and some restrictions on other races. With regard to classes, there are two new classes, and several new subclasses. 

## Ability Scores

- **Roll** 4d6 and drop the lowest. Do this six times.  if *none* of your scores are 14 or higher,  or if the set has *two or more* scores of 8 or under you may roll a new set of six. You must take the new set. 
- When choosing a race, racial ability bonuses can be applied to *any* score, with a maximum of +2 to any single ability.

## New Classes

-  **[[psion-ermis|Psion]]**: A psychic class with three subclasses: Wilder, Inquisitor, and Tactician. There are also several available psionic subclasses for other classes, including the Fighter (Psi-Knight), Rogue (Soul-Blade), and Sorcerer (Aberrant Mind). Most psions are found, inducted, and trained by the Gnostari -- the psychic order of The Dyarchy. The Gnostari actively seek out and recruit any beings that manifest any significant psychic ability. If a character has psychic powers but does not want to be "recruited" into the Gnostari, then that character had better keep their powers a secret and perhaps also live in a remote place. There are rumors that both the Haim Collective and the Fair harbor various psychics who are of significant power but have no wish to serve the Gnostari.
- **[[pugilist-sterlingvermin|Pugilist]]**: Pugilists unconsciously tap into their own inner strength in the form of "moxie". This is not an esoteric or mystical energy that flows through the multiverse, but the result of determination forged over a lifetime of hardship with a never-say-die attitude. You can teach someone how to fight but you could never teach someone how to be a pugilist. The secret of mastering moxie doesn't come from disciplined study or rigorous training, it comes from years of wanting and needing

## New Subclasses

NOTE: These all still require playtesting so please be aware that tweaks might need to be made as the game progresses. 

- **[[wizard-kinemancer-ermis|Kinemancer]]** (Wizard): experts in manipulating attractive and repulsive force.
- **[[wizard-orimancer-ermis|Orimancer]]** (Wizard): experts at manipulating the limits, boundaries, and measure of space and time.
- **[[cleric-power-domain-ermis|Power Domain]]** (Cleric) : a focus on the promotion of life, the freedom from external constraints or conditions, and the connection of each being's existence to that of others and the fate of all.
- **[[rogue-tinkerer-ermis|Tinkerer]]** (Rogue):  a master of cobbling materials together, though perhaps they don't always work as intended.

## Species & Lineage

In addition to Human, the following species and lineages are available for play on Ermis: Dhampir, Giff, Goliath, Hadozee, Harengon, Hexblood, Loxodon, Plasmoid, Thri-Kreen, Vedalken. There are also some new additional species & lineages:

- **[[auton-ermis|Auton]]**: A living mechanical construct. 
- **[[doloi-ermis|Doloi]]**: A kind of goblinoid; may be small or medium in size. 
- **[[the-faeir-ermis|The Faeir]]**: Humanoid fey creatures, they are enigmatic and aloof.
- **[[haemin-ermis|Haemin]]**:   Humanoids small of stature but big in their ideas (like if dwarves, halflings, and gnomes were just one race…). 

Ermis lacks many standard D&D ancestries/races. You **cannot** play a Dwarf, Dragonborn, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, or Tiefling.

## Background

The PHB backgrounds are all available as usual. There is one new background -- the Renegade. There are also a few other backgrounds that work well on Ermis. These are: 

- [[house-agent-erlw|House Agent]]
- [[renegade-ermis|Renegade]]
