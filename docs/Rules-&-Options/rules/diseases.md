# Diseases

## Arcane Blight
_Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 233_

Any humanoid that spends 12 hours in the necropolis must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract an arcane blight. This magical disease transforms the humanoid into a [nothic](../../../nothic.md), but only after the victim experiences hallucinations and feelings of isolation and paranoia. Other symptoms include clammy skin, hair loss, and myopia (nearsightedness).

A player character infected with the arcane blight gains the following flaw: "I don't trust anyone." This flaw, which supersedes any conflicting flaw, is fed by delusions that are difficult for the character to distinguish from reality. Common delusions include the belief that that allies are conspiring to steal the victim's riches or otherwise turn against the victim.

Whenever it finishes a long rest, an infected humanoid must repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for future saves against the arcane blight drops by `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`). If the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature overcomes the arcane blight and becomes immune to the effect of further exposure. A creature that fails three of these saving throws transforms into a [nothic](../../../nothic.md) under the DM's control. Only a [wish](../../../wish.md) spell or divine intervention can undo this transformation.

A [greater restoration](../../../greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic ends the infection on the target, removing the flaw and all other symptoms, but this magic doesn't protect the target against further exposure.

## Arcane Wasting
_Source: Tome of Beasts p. 215_

An outbreak of arcane wasting is always met with horror, but that fear is felt tenfold by practitioners of magic both arcane and divine.

When the bodily fluid of an infected creature touches a humanoid or when an infected creature casts a spell (direct or indirect) on a humanoid, that humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with arcane wasting. Beginning `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) days after infection, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest. If the saving throw fails, the victim loses `dice: 1d3|avg` (`1d3`) Intelligence and `dice: 1d3|avg` (`1d3`) Wisdom. Lost Intelligence and Wisdom can't be recovered while the disease persists. If the saving throw succeeds, nothing happens; the disease ends after the second consecutive successful saving throws. Once the disease ends, lost Intelligence and Wisdom can be restored by [greater restoration](../../../greater-restoration.md) or comparable magic. The disease is also cured by [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md) if the caster makes a successful DC 15 spellcasting check.

## Blinding Sickness
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is [blinded](./conditions.md##blinded).

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](../../../contagion.md) spell.

## Bog Rot
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 p. 309_

Until the disease is cured, the infected creature's skin breaks out in a rot-like rash that slowly spreads across its body, and its hp maximum decreases by `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) for every 24 hours that elapse. After the first 24 hours, the creature's skin starts to smell like rot, and creatures have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](./skills.md##Perception)) and Wisdom ([Survival](./skills.md##Survival)) checks to find the infected creature. The reduction and rot smell last until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0.

## Bonerot
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 p. 299_

An infected creature develops the first symptoms of general weakness and lethargy within 1 hour as its bones start to rot from the inside. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or its Strength and Dexterity scores are each reduced by `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) and its walking speed is reduced by 5 feet. The reductions last until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Strength or Dexterity to 0, the creature dies. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the disease recovers from it. Alternatively, the disease can be removed by the [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md.md) spell or similar magic.

## Cackle Fever
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: "the shrieks."

Symptoms manifest `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion) that can't be removed until the disease is cured.

Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) psychic damage and becomes [incapacitated](./conditions.md##incapacitated) with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the [incapacitated](./conditions.md##incapacitated) condition on a success. Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`). When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of [Madness](./variant-rules/madness.md).

## Carrion Curse
_Source: Creature Codex p. 92_

Within a day, a dark discoloration around the wound is accompanied by the smell of putrefying flesh. Unless serious measures are taken to mask the smell, carrion eaters of all kinds will be drawn to the infected creature, gaining advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](./skills.md##Perception)) checks to track the creature by smell within their usual range.

While infected with carrion curse, a creature can't be healed magically and can only heal naturally through rest and by spending hit dice. At the end of each long rest, a creature infected with carrion curse must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion). If an infected creature succeeds on the saving throw, it no longer gains [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion) levels each day. A second successful save at the end of a long rest cures the disease. The abyssal disease resists many efforts at treatment and can only be cured by a [greater restoration](../../../greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.

A living creature that dies from the effects of carrion curse has a 75% chance chance of rising again as a [blood zombie](../../../blood-zombie-ccodex.md) within 24 hours.

## Catscratch Fugue
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 p. 58_

Catscratch fugue is a bacterial infection that only affects felids and feline humanoids. This infectious organism is carried by debris falling into the Material Plane from the Void and is transmitted either through contact with the crash site or by being bitten by a carrier.

Upon contact, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Once the host is infected, catscratch fugue incubates inside it for 3 days. During this window, the victim's skin itches, and they are prone to violent mood swings. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature can repeat the saving throw, recovering from the disease on a success. A [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md.md) spell cast during the incubation time cures the disease.

After the third day, if the infection is still present, any negative emotion causes the victim to transform into a monstrous [catscratch](../../../catscratch-tob2.md) intent on destroying everything around it. Only a [wish](../../../wish.md.md) spell can cure a [catscratch](../../../catscratch-tob2.md) once it has transformed.

## Creeping Cold
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 p. 371_

At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each day or take `dice: 2d8|avg` (`2d8`) cold damage and `dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`) necrotic damage and suffer one level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion) if the creature has no levels of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion). The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion) and hp maximum reduction last until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's hp maximum to 0, the creature dies, and it rises as a winterghast `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) hours later. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the diseases recovers from it. Alternatively, the disease can be removed by the [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md.md) spell or similar magic.

## Darakhul Fever
_Source: Tome of Beasts p. 215_

Spread mainly through bite wounds, this rare disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. A creature so afflicted must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. Failure costs the victim `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) Constitution damage and `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) Dexterity damage. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days, but the accumulating Constitution damage makes this less likely with each passing day. [Greater restoration](../../../greater-restoration.md.md.md.md) cures the disease; cure disease allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Once the disease is cured, the victim recovers 2 Dexterity points per day naturally, but only magic can restore the lost Constitution.

Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible.

If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`), add the character's current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.

**Adjustment Table**

| dice: d20 + #$prompt_number:min=1,title=Enter Constitution Modifier,default=1$# | Result |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1-9 | None, victim is simply dead |
| 10-16 | [Ghoul](../../../ghoul.md) |
| 17-20 | [Ghast](../../../ghast.md) |
| 21-99 | [Darakhul](../../../darakhul-ghoul-tob.md) |
^adjustment-table

## Darakhul Fever
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 p. 167_

Spread mainly through bite wounds, this disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. An infected creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. On a failed save, the victim takes `dice: 4d6|avg` (`4d6`) necrotic damage, and its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the victim finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The victim recovers from the disease by making two consecutive successful saving throws. [Greater restoration](../../../greater-restoration.md.md.md.md) cures the disease, while [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md.md) gives the victim advantage on the next saving throw.

Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect [ogres](../../../ogre.md), and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If a creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`), add the character's Constitution modifier, and find the result on the table below to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1–9 | None; victim is simply dead |
| 10–16 | [Ghoul](../../../ghoul.md) |
| 17–20 | [Ghast](../../../ghast.md) |
| 21+ | Darakhul |

## Filth Fever
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](../../../contagion.md) spell.

## Flesh Rot
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](../../../contagion.md) spell.

## Ghoul Gut
_Source: The Orrery of the Wanderer p. 111_

Water polluted with ghoul parts carries ghoul gut. A creature drinking this tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the disease. Symptoms strike when a victim starts a long rest or next becomes excited, as during combat. A victim suffers severe cramps, and their bowels make sounds like two ghouls fighting. When the symptoms first strike, the victim takes `dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`) necrotic damage. In addition, a diseased victim regains no hit points or Hit Dice from nonmagical sources, including resting or spending Hit Dice. A victim who finishes a long rest can attempt a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the victim shakes off the disease. Failure deals the character another `dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`) necrotic damage.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](./skills.md##Medicine)) check can also remove the disease from another creature. Doing so requires the character making the check to care for the sick individual during a long rest. The caregiver gains no benefit from that rest.

## Iumenta Pox
_Source: Creature Codex p. 395_

It takes `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) days for iumenta pox's symptoms to appear in an infected humanoid. A creature with iumenta pox has trouble breathing, and its skin erupts with painful green boils that ooze pus. As the disease progresses, these pustules turn black.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage. The creature's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. When an infected creature dies, its corpse rises as a mold zombie `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) hours after death. Iumenta pox can be cured with two successful saving throws.

## Mindfire
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [confusion](../../../confusion.md) spell during combat.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](../../../contagion.md) spell.

## Ooze Plague
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 p. 297_

Until the disease is cured, the infected creature's skin slowly becomes more ooze-like, and its hp maximum decreases by `dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`) for every 24 hours that elapse. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this disease rises 24 hours later as an [ochre jelly](../../../ochre-jelly.md).

## Ophio Spores
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 p. 158_

This disease affects humanoids who breathe. The eyes of infected creatures become glassy, and purple bruising appears on their spines, bulging as the disease progresses. At the end of each long rest after infection, an infected creature is wracked by terrible dreams or visions and must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion) that can't be removed until the disease is cured. After the creature has two levels of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion), it moves to the second stage of the infection. During the first stage of infection, a [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md.md) spell or similar magic ends the infection.

At the end of each long rest after the creature reaches the second stage of infection, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become a thrall of the ophio fungus, falling completely under its control. A victim in the second stage of the infection or that is completely under the fungus' control can be restored only by killing the fungus that caused the infection or through the use of a [wish](../../../wish.md.md.md) spell.

## Saprophytic Plague
_Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 253_

Xanthoria's research into lichdom and her creation of a living phylactery led to the emergence of the plague spreading across the Sword Coast. Any beast or humanoid that comes within 10 feet of a creature infected by the saprophytic plague must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or become infected as well. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the plague for 24 hours, and any creature that is immune to disease succeeds on the save automatically.

After a failed save, a creature experiences the first symptoms—body aches, nausea, slurred speech, and uncontrollable drooling—`dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) hours later and gains 1 level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion). Every 24 hours thereafter, the creature automatically gains another level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion). Any creature killed by the saprophytic plague transforms into a lifeless magenta ooze.

A creature infected by the saprophytic plague for at least 24 hours behaves like a zombie and seems barely aware of its surroundings, as fungal growths sprout from its head, body, and limbs. It feels an overriding urge to be around groups of uninfected creatures so that it can spread the contagion. This is the time when infected humanoids begin speaking the word "Xanthoria" over and over, with no understanding of what the word means. This behavior is the result of a mycelial network of spores that forms a tenuous connection between Xanthoria and humanoids that become infected by the plague.

Foodstuffs that are exposed to the plague's spores decay or go sour within `dice: 2d12|avg` (`2d12`) hours, leaving behind a lurid magenta mass of oozing fungi. Eating infected food requires a saving throw as above.

Any magic that cures a disease can rid a creature of the saprophytic plague. Casting [purify food and drink](../../../purify-food-and-drink.md) destroys the infection in foodstuffs.

## Seeping Death
_Source: Creature Codex p. 288_

At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its Dexterity score is reduced by `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`). The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies and its body becomes a [suppurating ooze](../../../suppurating-ooze-ccodex.md) `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) hours later. The disease lasts until removed by the [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md.md) spell or other similar magic.

## Seizure
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](../../../contagion.md) spell.

## Sewer Plague
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.

When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.

It takes `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion), and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion).

On a successful save, the character's [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion) level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion) below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

## Sight Rot
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.

A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is [blinded](./conditions.md##blinded) until its sight is restored by magic such as [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md.md) or [heal](../../../heal.md).

Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an [herbalism kit](../../../herbalism-kit.md) can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

## Slimy Doom
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is [stunned](./conditions.md##stunned) until the end of its next turn.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](../../../contagion.md) spell.

## The Gnawing Plague
_Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 153_

The Gnawing Plague, also known as "the Gnaws," is known in every corner of Richemulot.

### Transmission

The Gnaws is spread when a creature is bitten by a [rat](../../../rat.md), [giant rat](../../../giant-rat.md), [swarm of rats](../../../swarm-of-rats.md), or [wererat](../../../wererat.md) that carries the disease, or by coming into physical contact with an infected creature.

### Infection

Creatures exposed to the disease must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become infected. The DC of this saving throw can increase depending on the severity of the plague's spread (see ""Cycle of the Plague"" below).

### Symptoms

It takes `dice: 1d2|avg` (`1d2`) days for the Gnawing Plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. The infected creature then gains 1 level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion), regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice, and regains no hit points from finishing a long rest.

The plague's symptoms include buboes, fatigue, splotchy rashes, sweats, and shaking, particularly facial tremors. Locals liken these twitches to the sniffing of rats. Sufferers often have scraps of leather placed in their mouths to prevent their teeth from clattering, though they inevitably gnaw through these scraps.

### Recovery

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion). On a successful save, the creature's [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion) level decreases by 1. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [exhaustion](./conditions.md##exhaustion) below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

### Immunity

All forms of rats and wererats are immune to the Gnawing Plague.

## The Ravening
_Source: Tome of Beasts 3 p. 272_

This affliction causes uncontrollable fury, and it can be transmitted by contact with infected fluids or clothing, or by the bite of a [ravening minotaur](../../../ravening-minotaur-tob3.md). The ravening is highly contagious and can infect giants, humanoids, and monstrosities. A creature exposed to it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Minotaurs have disadvantage on the saving throw.

After 24 hours, the infected creature gains the [ravening minotaur's](../../../ravening-minotaur-tob3.md.md) Ravening Hunger and Ravening Madness traits until cured. If the infected creature is cured after its hp maximum increased from Ravening Hunger, it retains its new hp maximum. After the first 24 hours, a minotaur infected with the ravening can be cured only by the [greater restoration](../../../greater-restoration.md) spell or similar powerful magic. Other creatures can be cured by the [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md.md) spell or similar disease-ending magic, as normal.
