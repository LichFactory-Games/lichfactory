# Familiars
*Source: Monster Manual p. 347* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [find familiar](../../../../find-familiar.md) spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [crawling claw](../../../../crawling-claw.md), an [imp](../../../../imp.md), a [pseudodragon](../../../../pseudodragon.md), or a [quasit](../../../../quasit.md).
