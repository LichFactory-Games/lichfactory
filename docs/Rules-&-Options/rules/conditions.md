# Conditions

## Blinded
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 290. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules._

- A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.  
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.  

## Charmed
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 290. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules._

- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.  
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.  

## Concentration
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 203. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules._

Some spells require you to maintain [concentration](conditions.md##concentration) in order to keep their magic active. If you lose [concentration](conditions.md##concentration), such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with [concentration](conditions.md##concentration), that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end [concentration](conditions.md##concentration) at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with [concentration](conditions.md##concentration). The following factors can break [concentration](conditions.md##concentration):

- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose [concentration](conditions.md##concentration) on a spell if you cast another spell that requires [concentration](conditions.md##concentration). You can't concentrate on two spells at once.  
- **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your [concentration](conditions.md##concentration). The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.  
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose [concentration](conditions.md##concentration) on a spell if you are [incapacitated](conditions.md##incapacitated) or if you die.  

The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain [concentration](conditions.md##concentration) on a spell.

## Dazed
_Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 1_

A **dazed** creature can only do one of the following things on their turn: move, use an action, or use a bonus action. If a creature becomes dazed during their turn, their turn ends. The *cure ailment* power, [lesser restoration](../../../lesser-restoration.md) spell, and [greater restoration](../../../greater-restoration.md) spell remove the dazed condition. At the GM's discretion, other powers, spells, or effects might also remove the dazed condition.

When a dazed creature is affected by a spell or effect that gives them an extra action on their turn (like the [haste](../../../haste.md) spell or the fighter's Action Surge feature), they can still take this extra action, in addition to the movement, action, or bonus action allowed by the dazed condition.

Some creatures in this book have immunity to the dazed condition. At the GM's discretion, a creature published in the core rules or another supplement who has immunity to the paralyzed or stunned condition also has immunity to the dazed condition.

## Deafened
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 290. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules._

- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.  

## Exhaustion
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 291. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules._

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Disadvantage on ability checks |
| 2 | Speed halved |
| 3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4 | Hit point maximum halved |
| 5 | Speed reduced to 0 |
| 6 | Death |
^level-effect

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.

## Falling Fortunes
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 p. 241_

A creature cursed with falling fortunes is plagued with bad luck for 24 hours. While cursed, the creature can't add its proficiency bonus to any attack rolls or ability checks. If the cursed creature rolls a 20 on an attack roll or an ability check, the curse ends. Alternatively, the curse can be lifted early by a [remove curse](../../../remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic.

## Flanked
_Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 1_

If your game uses the optional flanking rules in the core rules, a creature who is immune to the **flanked** condition can't be flanked regardless of the position of their enemies.

- The condition ends if the grappler is [incapacitated](conditions.md.md###incapacitated).

## Incapacitated
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 290. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules._

- An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.  

## Invisible
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 291. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules._

- An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.

## Minor Surface Curse
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 p. 245_

A creature cursed with a minor surface curse feels pain when exposed to natural light. While cursed and in sunlight or moonlight, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([Perception](./skills.md##Perception)) checks. The curse ends if the affected creature completes a long rest in darkness. Alternatively, the curse can be lifted early by a [remove curse](../../../remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic.
