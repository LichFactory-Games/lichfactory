"Save-or-Suck" was a term originating in 3e.

1e, 2e, 3e and 3.5e had a class of spells commonly called "Save-or-Dies". Stuff like Finger of Death, Disintegrate, Slay Living, Phantasmal Killer, etc. Basically, if your character didn't make their save, they would die outright. These spells were usually of a higher level (4+) and usually did nothing if the target saved.

In 1e and 2e, monster health didn't scale linearly - the scaling fell off hard at higher levels. This means that blasting spells didn't fall off like they did in later editions, and blasting was a viable way to play a caster-type. This was no longer the case as of 3.0e. That said, spells that killed or disabled monsters on a save did scale (because the save DCs scaled and the effects were every bit as debilitating early on as they were later - sometimes even more so). So people started to build casters as "battlefield controllers".

It soon became clear on early CharOp forums that Save-or-Die spells were good, but they were usually overly expensive for the effects that they offered. Some spells were far more efficient and would basically result in the target being unable to fight back indefinitely (but didn't kill outright). These were often lower level, were harder to resist, or were multi-target compared to traditional save-or-dies. Examples include Dominate Person or Baleful Polymorph. These are your "Save-or-Lose" spell (i.e., the monster saves or they "lose" or "are as good as dead")

People soon caught on that this was a really effective way to play casters, and it became common to recommend even lower level spells with debilitating effects, affecting even more targets. These spells didn't make the monsters lose outright, but removed their ability to effectively fight back. A monster could save against a level 7 Finger of Death and be mostly unaffected, but you could force 3-4 monsters to save against a level 2 Glitterdust or Web, and those that failed were usually of no threat to anyone while the spell was ongoing. These spells were called "Save-or-Suck(s)", because the target needs to save or else they "suck".

5e did away with most "Save-or-Die" and "Save-or-Lose" spells, but many "Save-or-Sucks" remain (usually at a higher level than previous, with many offering multiple saves to avoid the full effect of the spell).
