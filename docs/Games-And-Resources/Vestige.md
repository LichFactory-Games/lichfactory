I've been working on and off on an investigative near-future sci-fi/horror game called *Vestige*. You can read more about the setting below. You can also check out the (work-in-progress) core book -- the [Vestige Field Manual](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t0wm2zg82vonimbrlgehf/vestige-field-manual.pdf?rlkey=4y6e7a51884lr4bomn3n3dias&st=iaiornc3&dl=0) -- and and an intro adventure -- [Echo Chamber](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/f2l8tn1j8scp8m2cdfceo/echo-chamber.pdf?rlkey=108kfl0a2f5rtbaurii6vvjwc&st=uj85yw4j&dl=0).

The aim of the game and setting is to be a different take on standard cyberpunk settings, and while being horror, not strictly cosmic horror like so many games are these days (don't get me wrong, I love Lovecraft!), and not about watching your character slowly come to pieces under the pressure of their work. 

## Operations Brief

### The World of 2065

The world has changed dramatically since the catastrophic events of the 2040s. The Null Event in 2043 erased vast swaths of digital records and history. It was followed by the White Death, a devastating fungal pandemic that claimed nearly a third of the world's population. In the chaos that followed, the United States fractured into several successor states, with the Federated States of America (FSA) emerging as one of the largest and most stable.

Today, society functions differently. The global internet is gone, replaced by isolated local networks connected by physical data couriers. Technology has advanced but is viewed with more suspicion, especially the neural-integrated "Daemon" computers that some blame for the Null. Cities are more self-contained, travel between regions is more restricted, and people have learned to be warier of both technology and authority.

### The National Security Bureau

The National Security Bureau serves as the FSA's primary investigative and security organization, combining the roles once held by agencies like the FBI and CIA. Since the Crash, the NSB has evolved to face both traditional criminal enterprises and strange phenomena or inexplicable incidents that seem to defy conventional explanation.

### Task Force Vestige

You are part of Task Force Vestige, an unconventional unit within the NSB led by the controversial Senior Special Agent Morgan Fox. The task force specializes in investigating cold cases from the Crash Years and unusual contemporary incidents that other departments can't or won't handle. 

As a member of Vestige, you might be a dedicated NSB agent, a specialist contractor, or an expert consultant. Your skills could range from forensics and investigation to academic research, technological expertise, or esoteric knowledge. What unites Vestige personnel is their willingness to look beyond conventional explanations and their ability to operate in the shadows between what is known and what is possible. For in the post-Crash world, the line between fact and fiction, between technology and the inexplicable, has become increasingly difficult to discern.

Typical Vestige investigations begin with seemingly routine incidentsâ€”unexplained technological glitches, statistical anomalies in medical data, recovered pre-Crash artifacts, or inconsistencies in historical records. These cases often reveal deeper implications, from potential corporate conspiracies and governmental cover-ups to dangerous technological innovations and unexplained social phenomena. Vestige's role is to investigate these mysteries, protect the public, and determine which truths need to be brought into the light.
