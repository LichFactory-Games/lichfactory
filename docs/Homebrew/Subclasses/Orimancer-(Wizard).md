*Orimancers* are experts at manipulating the limits, boundaries, and measure of space and time. "Orimancy" is the wizardly term for the study (or "school") of this technique. Orimancers are one of wizarding schools primary responsible for maintaining the functioning of the Spar transport system, as well as the various enchantments that allow the city of Omerth to maintain its position floating at the center of the world. 

## Class Features

### Scholar of Magnitude (Level 2)

Because of the intellectual demands of Orimancy, specialists of this school tend to have notable mental acuity, and have become adept at research and study. You gain proficiency in Arcana and Investigation. If you are already proficient in these skills, you gain expertise.

### Warp Space (Level 2)

You gain the ability to manipulate space around you, allowing you to teleport yourself or another willing creature within eyesight a short distance as a bonus action. You can teleport a distance up to five times your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 5 feet), and you must have line of sight to the destination. You may use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to take a short or long rest.

### Reactive Displacement (Level 6)

You may spatially or temporally displace yourself as a reaction to danger or attack. When an object or creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to displace yourself with respect to the attacker such that it automatically misses you. You do not move or otherwise teleport from your current position, but you are not present at the precise moment the attacker strikes. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, or until you finish a long rest.

### Infinite Expanse (Level 10)

As an action, you can choose one or more creatures (total equal to your Intelligence bonus, minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you that you can see. The creatures must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC or be caught up in an infinite spatial or temporal field that requires all bodily activity to traverse an infinite expanse – this effectively paralyzes the creature(s) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Additionally, if the target(s) of a Hold Person or Hold Monster spell cast by you fail the saving throw, they must now make an Intelligence saving throw instead of a Wisdom saving throw.

### Changeless Being (Level 14)

You become a master of time and space, gaining immunity to the effects of aging. Spells or abilities that alter time or age cannot affect you against your will, and you cannot be spatially displaced, teleported, or plane shifted against your will.
