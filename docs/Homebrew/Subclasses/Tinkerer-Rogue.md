# Tinkerer

The tinkerer is a master of cobbling materials together to fulfill some need, practical or otherwise. A tinkerer may also (though need not) be a "tinker", i.e., a person who travels from place to place, repairing household utensils or small mechanical objects, such as pots, pans, and tools. Either way the tinkerer has a deep interest in understanding how things work and figuring out how to fix or improve them.

Tinkerers are typically self-taught, or have had at best a smattering of formal training, likely in a variety of different areas. As a result their workmanship is less an expression of their grasp of universal engineering principles and more a function of their particular life experience, needs, and tastes. Tinkerer constructions can be quite wondrous, but also tend to be rather volatile. Tinkerers tend to be streetsmart, creative, independent, and resourceful.
## Class Features

### Mechanical Tinkering (Level 3)
You are adept at constructing or fixing a variety of mechanical devices. All tinkering requires a check against the tinkerer's Tinker's Tools proficiency of DC of 8 + the complexity level of the item plus any other relevant modifiers for time or materials. You may use tool proficiency together with skill proficiency at gain advantage or special benefits. See the rules in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, pp. 78-85 for further details. 

#### Tool Proficiency
You gain proficiency in two tool sets of your choice, one of which must be tinker's tools if you are not already proficient in them. You gain one additional tool proficiency at levels 5, 7, 11, and 13. You must have expertise in at least two of tinker's tools, smith's tools, alchemist's tools, or carpenter's tools, before you can gain expertise in any other tool set.

Note that proficiency in tinker's tools doesn't just mean the tinkerer knows how to use hand tools. Proficiency also means they know how to be a successful tinkerer. Situations in which a skill check may be called for to which the tinkerer may add their tinker tool proficiency might include:

- Understanding the function of a machine, including how to turn it on/off and what its weaknesses or fail points might be
- Gaining insight into a clue which has a mathematical, theoretical, or mechanical basis
- Building something useful out of scraps or random materials under pressure
- Recalling random, but useful, information from previous studies

All of these types of actions should have proficiency added to their skill check roll for a proficient tinkerer.
#### Fast Production
You may produce an item, tool, or construct with unusual rapidity. However, these products are prone to volatility and breakage. The more complex the item or the more quickly it is produced, the more likely that something will go wrong. When using Fast Production, you can create an item, tool, or construct in half the normal time it would take to create it. However, the DC for the creation of the item is based on its complexity score plus 10. If you wish to further reduce the time required for production, you may do so, but for each further unit increment of time (i.e. for each unit of measurement as minutes/hours/days/weeks), you add an additional 2 to the DC of the creation check. If the DC is not met during the creation process, the device is either destroyed or rendered non-functional, and you must start over.

#### Restoration
When it comes to repair, so long as an item has not been completely destroyed you can expend an action and try to restore it to a minimal level of functionality. Roll your tinker's proficiency against a DC 10 + the complexity level of the item. If successful you can restore 1 HP to an item in a single turn; you can restore up to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier to an item in 1 minute outside of combat. Otherwise repair rules are as normal.

### Tool Improvisation (Level 3)
You always seem to be able to jury-rig a tool from whatever materials you have on hand (so long as there are materials on hand), for whatever particular need you currently have. Such tools are prone to breakage. For any tool so improvised for use in a DC check, a roll of 5 or under automatically fails and the tool is destroyed; a roll of 6-10 consumes the tool, whether or not the check succeeds. Higher rolls leave the tool unaffected. At seventh level reduce this likelihood of breakage by two, and reduce by 2 again at fourteenth level.

### Firearm Proficiency (Level 3 – Optional)
The secrets of creating and operating gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in "chapter 9" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" and your tinkerer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your tinkerer is proficient with them.

### Problem Solver (Level 9)
You rapidly generate solutions under pressure. As a bonus action you can do one of the following:

- *Tactical Assistance*: When you or another ally within your field of vision and with whom you can communicate makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.  
- *Retaliation*: When a creature misses you with a melee attack, roll an Intelligence check against the creature's Dexterity. If you succeed you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the creature (no sneak attack). If you hit, you add your Intelligence modifier to the attack's damage roll.  
- *Clever Diversion*: When you successfully hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can give your allies an opening. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if that attack is made before the start of your next turn.  

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Adaptive Design (Level 13)
You can quickly adapt existing devices to suit the situation at hand. This allows you to reconfigure one of your existing devices to perform a different function. The complexity level of the device you are reconfiguring will determine the DC of the Tinkerer's Tools check needed to successfully reconfigure it. This DC is equal to 12 + the level of the device you are reconfiguring (if applicable).

For example, if you wanted to reconfigure a gadget that provides defensive cover (which has a complexity level of 4) to create a temporary bridge over a chasm, the DC of the Tinkerer's Tools check would be 16 (12 + the device level of 4). However, if you wanted to reconfigure a more complex device like a clockwork spider (which has a complexity level of 7), the DC of the check would be 19 (12 + the device level of 7).

### Master Inventor (Level 17)
You have become a true master of your craft. You can create complex devices quickly and efficiently, without needing to spend as much time on trial and error. This means that whenever you use tools to create a device of CL 3 or lower, you can do so in 1/4 the time and with 1/4 the cost of materials. For Cl 4 or higher you may halve the time and material costs.
