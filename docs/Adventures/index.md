Adventures for the campaign setting of Erspace, a wildspace system that is isolated from the rest of the prime material plane and largely lost to the collective memory of the multiverseâ€¦

There are two adventures I'm currently working on. The first, "Ad Astra", is a 1-10 lvl adventure starting on Ermis and eventually leading to the discovery of Wildspace and other life in the Erspace system. The adventure has cults, interstellar eldritch horrors, the machinations of the illithids, and many other things. 

The second adventure, "Per Aspera", is a lvl 3-15 adventure set in the ring wastes of the inner belt, where the characters fight to be free of the tyranny of the [[Ermis BBEG|a'lhruhyn]] and the horrors of the void. There are rumors of an ancient being that the a'lhruhn intend to summon in the hopes of finding an escape from Erspace, as well as of a planet that is far more interesting than it first appears. 

*Ad Astra* and *Per Aspera* overlap in many of their events, NPCs, and "fronts", but one is not a sequel to the other. Instead they explore Erspace from different angles, one starting with "groundling" characters who slowly learn of the existence of outer space, and the other of seasoned "Wildspacers" engaged in a never-ending war for their freedom.
