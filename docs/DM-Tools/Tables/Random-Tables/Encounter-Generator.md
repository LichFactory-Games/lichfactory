## The 4 Encounter Types[^1]
 - **Combat encounters** are rewarded with experience points and loot, and are punished with damage. Prepare monster stat blocks.
- **Social encounters** are rewarded with lore, gifts, and allies, and punished with secrets, enemies, and theft. Prepare NPC profiles for personages, but wanderers and victims can be improvised. 
- **Skill encounters** are rewarded with supplies, shortcuts, and rest; and punished with delay and exhaustion. Prepare the locations if necessary but let the players suggest how to move forward. This is a good place for puzzles and traps if your players like them. 
- **Roleplay encounters** are rewarded with lore, inspiration and small magic boons, and punished with loss of inspiration, exhaustion, and minor curses. The party rolls wisdom or constitution saves, and success determines whether they receive the benefits the location holds. Prepare an evocative description of the location (or prepare to improvise) and ask "How does your character feel when you see this?" Encourage the players to ask each other this as well, and to reflect on the scene together.

| 8   | Havens         | Skill          | A sheltered place that offers rest and recuperation - although others may seek it as well. Depending on how well the party does on their checks, they get a long rest, a short rest, no rest, or exhaustion. |
| 9   | Ruins          | Roleplay       | Offer insight into the history of the land and a context for the party's adventures.                                                                                                                         |

| 12  | Personages     | Social         | These are important NPCs with a name, a motivation, and important secrets. They should be tied to factions or the main quest or introduce new quest lines.                                                   |
