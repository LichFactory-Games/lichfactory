Jewelry with stones already set (including rings, amulets, earrings, etc.), are readily available based on the gemstone availability, at the DM's discretion. Suggestions for gemstone values and descriptions are available in the DMG on page 134.

The "Powdering of Gems" service is an as needed task as most places aren't interested in keeping smashed up gemstones on hand. Some bigger locations may keep a few of the less valuable gems already powdered and bagged, but most places will do it on an as needed basis. More often than not, the customer would need to provide the gem in addition to paying the fee listed in the chart.

As with all locations, some services may have items not shown typically available on this chart or may offer services not typical for the area. These may come at a higher premium or be a service they only offer as a special reward for a job they need done as well.

Important note - 'Gem Shop' prices are based off a simple system of size vs. price, all gems are sold as large (Default price in the DMG guide located on page 134) and as such the price by gem size can be altered to suit your needs. "I.e. Large = 1:1, Medium = 1:10, Small = 1:100, Tiny = 1:1000".

To use this in an example for spell casting 'Chromatic Orb – 1st level, Evocation' requires 'A Diamond worth at least 50 gp' so in this case a default 1:1 Large Diamond is worth 5000 gp and as such "5000/50=100" so in this case a 1:100 Small diamond is wor th the required 50 gp to cast the spell.
