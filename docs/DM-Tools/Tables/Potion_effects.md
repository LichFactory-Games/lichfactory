7. You hear the jingle of a little cat bell until the next dawn but can never locate it
8. You physically perceive yourself in third person, you alone also see a floating green gem above your head. However it is intangible.
9. You think there's a goldfish in your stomach and you have to protect it at all costs because you expect to be able to poop a gold fish.
10. Hair grows 1d12 inches over the next 5 minutes, and the new hair grows [γ], and remains that way.

16. You have an uncanny sense that you're being tracked by a goose for 1d8 days
17. Until the next dawn you're unable to pass through a doorway without an invitation from someone on the other side (Cave and building entering and exiting, and moving between rooms that have an obvious doorway)
18. Every hour until the next dawn, you develop a new phobia that replaces the previous one. The phobia is chosen at DM discretion.
19. Nothing seems to happen straight away. The next long rest the affected character has the most pleasing dream they've ever had. To the rest of the party, this involves sleep walking and talking like they're having a nightmare. The affected character wakes up as if after the most refreshing night's sleep.
20. Like a moth to a flame, you are drawn to the brightest lightsource that you can see. This effect ends if you take damage, or after 15 minutes. (Damage such as walking into a fire, or jumping off of something trying to get to the sun)

22. Your [χ] becomes as flexible as rubber for 1d4 hours
23. You become acutely aware of one particular goblin, kobold, or similar creature, regardless of distance for one hour, so long as the two inhabit the same plane of existence.
24. You develop a minor allergy to any bread that was not made by a Half-orc. 
25. You spontaneously become aware that if you do not do a silly dance, your [χ] will fall off your body. If you don't, it falls off your body. (If the selected is head, and the dance is not done, the detachment has no perceivable issues. Eating, drinking, breathing, and speech all function normally. This may cause people to mistake you as a Dullahan-like creature.)
26. You become incapable of lying for the next 1d4 hours.
27. Your shadow, wherever it exists, is perceived by everyone except you as [γ] in color for 1d12 days.
28. Your [χ] becomes immobile, but remains functional otherwise for 1d4 hours. 
29. The next person you touch becomes sick suddenly, and takes the poisoned condition until you stop touching them, or for one hour. If you take your hand off of the person, the sickness moves to you for the remaining duration. 
30. Forest animals are attracted to your scent for 1d8 hours, hostile or otherwise.
31. A luminous intangible orb becomes visible nearby, and regardless of your affinity for magic, you immediately recognize it as the 'Clairvoyance' spell. This orb is only perceptible by you. (Someone's watching…)
32. All of your clothing's primary coloration becomes [γ]. If it is the same color as your existing color, roll again until you get a different color.
33. All magic you cast for the next 1d4 days looks cartoonishly abnormal. During the same time, any time you land a melee attack, you hear comic-book style stock-sounds like "Wham" and "Whack". If you miss, you hear things like "Whiff" and "Whoosh". Everyone perceives this effect as coming from you.
34. The next time you long rest, you dream of a fairy offering you a choice between a coin and a quill. The DM may decide if anything occurs as a result of your choice, in the dream or in the real world. 
35. You smell of elderberries for 1d6 hours, and are certain that someone in a far-off land has insulted your son, even if you don't have one. 
36. The next time you see a halfling, you become compelled to refer to them as a 'Cantankerous Midget'. After the first time you say this, the effect ends.  
37. You cannot hear your own name when spoken by others for 1d8 days.
38. Your eyes become [γ] permanently, and those who see them are surprised at their beauty. If you receive the blind condition at any point with these eyes, they pop like confetti, and the effect ends with your eyes returning to normal.
39. You are certain that you hear a traveling circus in the distance, but the music never seems to change direction or distance and remains omnipresent around you. Others can only perceive this music if they physically maintain contact with you, upon removing contact they can no longer hear it. This effect lasts for 1d4 days. 
40. Roll twice, if the two results conflict, flip a coin, with heads being the first. If this is rolled again, ignore it and take the other roll.
