# Lazy Traps
## Build a Tool Kit
## Simple Mechanics

Most game systems offer references for trap damage and mechanics in one or some of the handbooks. Reference these while planning encounters and sessions and make note of options appropriate for your party.

Mechanics should be simple. Your traps should be mostly restricted to damage with single target or multi-target damage effects for simplicity.

## Reskin and Reflavor

Monsters and spells can be a source of inspiration for trap design. For both, make sure to set a few DCs for detection and disarming.

Monsters can be reskinned into traps by removing most of the statblock and keeping at least one attack. For spells, all you have to do is decide the caster level.

## Flavor is so Important it Gets Two Headings

Try to spice up your traps and tie them into their surroundings. Some examples from Sly Flourish[^lazy-traps]:

- A crossbow trap is a statue of a maiden holding a bow 
- a spike trap is a mechanical manticore 
- a pair of gargoyles that laugh and spit poison darts
## Traps That Make Sense

Traps tell a story. An ancient dungeon that hasn't been opened in 10,000 years will have big simple mechanical traps. Run of the mill goblins won't use arcane wards, and wizards won't dig pit traps when they can use glyphs of warding. 

## Resetting

Heat and water make great sources of power for resetting traps. Consider narrating the sound of flowing water, turning gears, or steam hissing to give depth to the scene and telegraph that the place is not completely inert.
