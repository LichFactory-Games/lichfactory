>>  - For any given task or challenge, ask yourself how hard it is to accomplish. 
>>  - Then assign a DC from 10 (easy) to 20 (very hard). 
>>  - If a task is trivial, don't bother asking for a roll. Rather, the characters automatically succeed. Likewise, reserve DCs above 20 for superhuman challenges.
>
>> [!info]+ Quick Builder
>> - Choose a challenge rating (CR) for your trap, object, effect, or creature between 1 and 30. When improvising statistics for traps and other objects that deal damage and can be attacked to destroy them, estimate the object's CR by comparing it to various creatures that produce the same sorts of effects in combat. Write down its statistics from the following formulas:
>> - AC = 12 + ½ CR (or choose between 10 and 20 based on the story)
>> - DC = 12 + ½ CR
>> - Hit Points = 20 × CR
>> - Attack Bonus = 3 + ½ CR
>> - Proficient Saves or Skills = 3 + ½ CR
>> - Single-Target Damage = 7 × CR (or 2d6 per CR)
>> - Multi-Target Damage = 3 x CR (or 1d6 per CR)
>
>> [!info]+ Deadly Encounter Benchmark
>>    - Choose monster types and numbers that make sense for the situation in the story.
>>    - Compare total monster challenge ratings to total character levels. 
>>    - An encounter may be deadly if total CRs are greater than these thresholds:

>> [!info]+ Other Improv Tricks
>> The following tricks can also help make it easier for you to improvise during your game:
>> - Use the story the players give to you, rather than forcing the characters to stick to a path you set.
>> - Use static monster damage.
>> - In combat, go around the table by player instead of rolling for initiative.
>> - Use advantage and disadvantage to reward unique approaches or clarify poor choices.
>> - Improve pacing by changing monster hit points on the fly to speed up or prolong a fight.
>> - Let the characters stumble upon two weak monsters, then see whether the monsters and characters want to fight or simply have a conversation.
