Here I have a variety of tools I use in DMing. These include many sorts of tables, A DM Screen, Some links to useful information on how to get the most from your players in developing their characters, and some useful monster building guides. At least some of this material won't render on the web as it relies on plugins that only work within Obsidian. But much else of it might nevertheless be useful.
