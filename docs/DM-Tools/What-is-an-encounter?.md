When designing encounters in a 5e adventure, consider the following elements:

1. **Known Information**: Manage what characters know before the encounter, balancing truth, detail, and relevance.
2. **Learned Information**: Provide new, confirming, or corrective information during the encounter, avoiding unnecessary obscurity.
3. **Goals**: Define clear, varied goals for each encounter, contributing to the adventure's narrative.
4. **NPCs**: Utilize diverse NPCs with distinct personalities and motivations, reusing them creatively.
5. **Threats/Challenges**: Offer a variety of challenges, not limited to combat, to engage players.
6. **Setting**: Design settings that impact encounter dynamics and challenge resolution.
7. **Choices**: Include meaningful choices, ensuring players have necessary information.
8. **Location and Purpose within Adventure**: Align encounter difficulty and purpose with the adventure's progression and narrative.
