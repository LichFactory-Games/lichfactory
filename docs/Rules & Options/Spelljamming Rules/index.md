Spelljammer 2e and 5e have some important differences, with 5e not being a clear improvement in all areas. So the rules I outline here are meant to be my take on the best way to integrate the Spelljammer system into D&D 5e. Here you'll find discussion of:

1. Setting & Lore 
2. Wildspace Rules 
3. Interstellar Space (Phlogisticated Space) Rules
4. Ship Rules 
5. Unique Spells & Magic Items
