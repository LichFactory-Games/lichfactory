# Race: The Faeir (Faeir Folk )

The Fǽir are known for their unsettling beauty, intelligence, and magic. Their origins are largely unknown, though there are rumors that they are somehow descended from human, elven, and various fey lineages.  They are sought after for their knowledge of arcane and mystical lore, which they guard closely.

The Fǽir can primarily be found living in secluded natural areas. Their settlements are often protected by enchantments and illusions that make them difficult for outsiders to locate. They have a reputation for being aloof and enigmatic, preferring to observe from a distance rather than engage with outsiders.

**Ability Scores**. Choose one of: 

- (a) Choose any +2, choose any other +1 
- (b) Choose any +1, choose any other +1, choose any other +1
- (c) your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.

**Age**. The Fǽir have long lifespans, often living for several centuries. They reach maturity at around 80 years of age.

**Alignment**. The Fǽir are generally chaotic or neutral in nature, with a strong sense of independence and a love for freedom.

**Size**. The Fǽir typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, with a varying build. Your size is either Small or Medium.

**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 35 feet.

**Fey Ancestry**. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Magic Resistance**. You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Meditation**. The Fǽir don't need to sleep. Instead they meditate deeply for 4 hours a day, remaining semiconscious during this time.  If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed. However, if you are not able to meditate for at least 4 hours during a 28 hour period you suffer a level of exhaustion. This level of exhaustion increases by 1 for every further 28 hour period until you either meditate, or die. Meditation is not a form of unconsciousness, hence you are not at a disadvantage to surprise or awareness of your surroundings, etc.

**Uncanny Presence**: The Fǽir are … different, unsettling, to non-Fǽir Folk. This does not mean it is necessarily unpleasant to be around one of the Fǽir, just that their presence always engenders a level of disquiet (in negative cases) or frisson (in positive ones). Add 1d4 to all Charisma ability checks and saving throws when made against another humanoid creature. Likewise, subtract 1d4 from all Charisma-based ability and skill checks made by other humanoid creatures insofar as they are directed specifically at the Fǽir creature. 

**Fey Magic**. At 1st level you know either the [[druidcraft|Druidcraft]] or [[minor-illusion|Minor Illusion]] cantrip. Additionally, at 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast the [[faerie-fire|Faerie Fire]]  spell once per short or long rest. At 5th level, you can also cast the [[misty-step|Misty Step]] spell once per short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

**Fey Features**: The Fǽir often have one or more distinctive physical traits, often appearing as distortions or caricatures of typical humanoid features. Choose a physical feature (in consultation with your DM), or roll on the following table:

| Roll 1d20 | Physical Feature                                                                                     |

| 18        | Eyes located in unusual places on the body, such as the palms of the hands or the knees.             |

| 20        | Sharper nails and teeth that give the character a predatory or feral appearance.                     |

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one additional language of your choice. Additionally, you can communicate with any fey creature, even if you don't share a common language.
