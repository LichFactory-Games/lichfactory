# Race: Auton

![[../../assets/img/automaton.png|left|275]]

Autons are sentient constructs, usually created by skilled artificers for specific purposes. They resemble humanoid figures made of metal, stone, wood, or a combination of these, and are imbued by technomancy with power sufficient to bring the mechanism to life.

Autons can be programmed to carry out simple or complex tasks, such as guarding a location, performing manual labor, or engaging in combat. Some are designed to mimic human behavior and emotions, while others are purely functional and lack any semblance of personality.

Despite their artificial nature, Autons are capable of learning and adapting to new situations. They can be equipped with various tools and weapons, making them versatile assets in many fields.

However, the creation of Autons is not without controversy. Some view them as threats to human employment or as dangerous potential weapons if they were to malfunction or fall into the wrong hands. Others argue that they should be treated as other sapient beings with their own rights and freedoms. Autons are still relatively rare on Ermis, though it is thought that they will inevitably increase in number due to their usefulness in carrying out various tasks.

**Ability Scores**  
Choose one of:  
(a) Choose any +2, choose any other +1;  
(b) Choose any +1, choose any other +1, choose any other +1;  
(c) Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

**Age**  
Autons do not age in the same way that biological creatures do. They can function indefinitely, provided their bodies are maintained and repaired as needed.

**Alignment**  
Autons are often neutral in alignment, but can have any alignment depending on their individual experiences and personalities.

**Size**  
Autons vary in size and shape, but are typically Medium.

**Speed**  
An Auton's base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Integrated Tool**  
Autons have an integrated tool of their choice, which functions as a tool proficiency. Examples include a blacksmith's hammer, a jeweler's kit, or a navigator's tools.

**Magical Resistance**  
Autons have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Inorganic Machine**  
Due to being made of metal, stone, wood, etc., Autons are immune to poison damage. They need neither food, nor drink, nor air, and they are immune to disease. However, Autons are uniquely vulnerable to things that interfere with their construction, like salt water or sand. Being sprayed with salt water (or being subject to very salty air) puts them at disadvantage for all rolls. Immersion in salt water causes 1d8 damage per turn and the Auton is at disadvantage on all rolls until they can be cleaned. Similar points hold for sand, etc. 

**Healing Machine**
If the mending spell is cast on an Auton, it can spend a Hit Die, roll it, and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus the Auton's Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

In addition, an Auton can benefit from several spells that preserve life but that normally don't affect Constructs: cure wounds, healing word, mass cure wounds, mass healing word, and spare the dying.

**Powering Down**  
Autons don't need to sleep, and magic can't put them to sleep, but they must spend six hours per twenty-four hour period inactive and motionless to gain the benefits of a long rest. During this time they are still aware of their surroundings.

**Hardened Form**  
Autons's construct bodies are delicate mechanisms, but they are nevertheless more resilient than flesh. When they aren't wearing armor, their AC is 13 + their Dexterity modifier. They can use this score to determine their AC if worn armor would leave them with a lower score. They may benefit from a shield as normal.

**Languages**  
Autons can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of their choice.
