# Stone Shape
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.

**Classes**: [Artificer](../classes/artificer-tce.md#), [Cleric](../classes/cleric.md#), [Druid (Circle of the Land)](../classes/druid-circle-of-the-land.md#), [Druid](../classes/druid.md#), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](../classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md#), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](../classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md#), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](../classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md#), [Warlock (The Genie)](../classes/warlock-the-genie-tce.md#), [Wizard](../classes/wizard.md#)
