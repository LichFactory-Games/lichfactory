## Class Features

### Ferocious Bond (Level 3)

Some beasthearts and companions feel closest when they abandon all control and let instinct guide their every move. When your companion enters a rampage, you feel every moment of their brutality, inspiring you to a battle fury all your own.

### Frenzied Charge (Level 3)

Starting when you choose this bond at 3rd level, you learn to follow your companion's furious lead. Whenever your companion enters a rampage, you can use a reaction to move up to your speed and make a melee weapon attack against a target at the end of the movement.

### Fury of the Wise (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, your experience with your companion's rage awes those who dare stand against you. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill if you do not already have it. Additionally, your Charisma (Intimidation) checks gain a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier.

### Energizing Rampage (Level 7)

At 7th level, your companion maintains their tenacity after going berserk. When your companion ends a rampage, their ferocity drops to 4 instead of 0.

### Furious Rampage (Level 11)

At 11th level, your companion can channel their fury into stronger strikes. Whenever your companion hits one of your enemies with a signature attack during a rampage, the attack deals extra damage equal to the companion's ferocity (instead of half their ferocity).

Additionally, whenever your companion attacks a target within 5 feet of you while in a rampage, they make the attack with advantage. If you attack a creature within 5 feet of your companion when you use Frenzied Charge, you make your attack with advantage.

### Invigorated Rampage (Level 15)

At 15th level, you and your companion can channel your anger into overwhelming strikes. When your companion hits another creature with their signature attack while in a rampage, or if you hit another creature with the attack granted to you by Frenzied Charge, the target is either [blinded](../../5e-rules/conditions.md##blinded), [deafened](../../5e-rules/conditions.md##deafened), or [frightened](../../5e-rules/conditions.md##frightened) of the attacker (your choice) until the end of the target's next turn.
