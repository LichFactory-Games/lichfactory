# Poison Rain (8 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 38* 

As an action, you cause toxic green rain to fall in a 20-foot cube centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area except for you and your companion must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](../../5e-rules/conditions.md##poisoned) until the end of your next turn.
