# Blind Fighting

*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 41* 

You have [blindsight](../../5e-rules/senses.md##blindsight) with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [blinded](../../5e-rules/conditions.md##blinded) or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [invisible](../../5e-rules/conditions.md##invisible) creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
