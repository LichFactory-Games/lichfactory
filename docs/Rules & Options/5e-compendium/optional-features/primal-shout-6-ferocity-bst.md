# Primal Shout (6 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29* 

As an action, you let loose a menacing bellow. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 15 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](../../5e-rules/conditions.md##frightened) of you until the end of your next turn.
