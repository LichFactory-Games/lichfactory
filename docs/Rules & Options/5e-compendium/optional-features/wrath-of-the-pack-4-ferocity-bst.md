# Wrath of the Pack (4 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29* 

When you hit a creature with an attack and that creature is within 5 feet of your companion, you can have your companion make a signature attack against the creature (no action required). On a hit, the attack deals its normal effects, and the target is knocked [prone](../../5e-rules/conditions.md##prone).
