- You gain proficiency in the [Acrobatics](../../5e-rules/skills.md##Acrobatics) or [Athletics](../../5e-rules/skills.md##Athletics) skill (your choice).  
- You have advantage on any Strength ([Athletics](../../5e-rules/skills.md.md##Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](../../5e-rules/skills.md.md##Acrobatics)) check you make to escape from being [grappled](../../5e-rules/conditions.md##grappled).
