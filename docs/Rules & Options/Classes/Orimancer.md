## Orimancer (Wizard )

![[../../assets/img/orimancer.png|right|325]]

*Orimancers* are experts at manipulating the limits, boundaries, and measure of space and time. Wizards of this tradition often dedicate themselves to the study of the nature of the cosmos, and seek to unlock its deepest secrets.

### Scholar of Magnitude

*2nd-level Orimancy feature*

You gain proficiency in Arcana and Investigation. If you are already proficient in these skills you gain an extra level of proficiency (i.e. you are an expert).

### Warp Space

*2nd-level Orimancy feature*

You gain the ability to manipulate space around you, allowing you to teleport yourself or another willing creature within eyesight a short distance as a bonus action. You can teleport a distance up to a number of feet equal to five times your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 5 feet), and you must have line of sight to the destination. You may use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to take a short or long rest.

### Reactive Displacement

*6th-level Orimancy feature*

You may spatially or temporally displace yourself as a reaction to danger or attack. When an object or creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to displace yourself with respect to the attacker such that it automatically misses you. You do not move or otherwise teleport from your current square, but you are not present at the precise moment the attacker strikes.

Once you use this feature, you can\'t use it again unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, or until you finish a long rest.

### Infinite Expanse

*10th-level Orimancy feature*

As an action, you can choose one or more creatures (total equal to plus your intelligence bonus, minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you that you can see. The creature(s) must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC or be caught up in an infinite spatial or temporal expanse that effectively causes them to be paralyzed until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this ability, you can\'t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, if the caster so desires, the target(s) of a Hold Person or Hold Monster spell must now make an *Intelligence* rather than *Wisdom* saving throw, reflecting the Orimancer\'s ability to paralyze through the manipulation of space and time rather than enchantment.

### Changeless Being

*14th-level Orimancy feature*

You become a master of time and space, gaining immunity to the effects of aging; spells or abilities that alter time or age cannot affect you against your will, nor can you be spatially displaced (e.g.Â pushed/pulled), teleported, or plane shifted against your will.
