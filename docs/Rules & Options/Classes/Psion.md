# Class: Psion

![[../../assets/img/psion.png|right|250]]

Though psychic abilities are not unheard of on Ermis, they tend to be rare. Psions are even rarer, for they are not simply people with psychic abilities, but rather people with both powerful psychic abilities and the training or time spent to focus on using those abilities to their utmost.

Most psions are found, inducted, and trained by the [[../../Erspace Almanac/Ermis/Pyntarch's Lives/Gnostari|Gnostari]] -- the psychic order of [[../../Erspace Almanac/Ermis/Pyntarch's Lives/The Dyarchy|The Dyarchy]]. The Gnostari actively seek out and recruit any beings that manifest any significant psychic ability. Their allegiance is to the Dyad and to furthering the word of Er. Little is known about their order other than that they have great psychic abilities and are zealous servants of the Dyarchy. They see there mission as being to safeguard the Dyad and the future of the Dyarchy and the word of Er at any cost.

If a character has psychic powers but does not want to be "recruited" into the Gnostari, then that character had better keep their powers a secret and perhaps also live in a remote place. There are rumors that both the Haim Collective and the Fair harbor various psychics who are of significant power but have no wish to serve the Gnostari.

> [!info]- Is Psionics a Form of Magic?
> 
> Psionics is a supernatural power that emanates from the mind. Like other forms of supernatural power in D&D, it can be used to create magical phenomena, but it also can create other sorts of phenomena. In the game's rules, only certain supernatural effects are classified as magical: magic items, spells, spell attacks, powers fueled by spell slots, and any other effect that the rules explicitly call magical. This distinction is rarely relevant in play, typically coming up only when something like an antimagic field shows up.
> 
> Psionic powers are suppressed by antimagic fields and can be dispelled with *[[dispel-magic|Dispel Magic]]*, but are only affected by *[[counterspell|counterspell]]* if the psionic power's description specifically indicates that it is the equivalent of a spell. Any check required to *[[dispel-magic|Dispel Magic]]*, *[[counterspell|counterspell]]* or to identify a spell that is cast with psionics is made with disadvantage unless the caster also has the Psionics feature. The *[[detect-magic|Detect Magic]]* spell will detect the usage of psionics, but not their nature: it will show up as a mysterious untyped power, even if being used to generate the effect of a spell.
> 
> When recreating a spell through a psionic effect (i.e. using a psionic aptitude to cast the spell) the spell has no verbal or material components (so long as they do not have a specified GP value), but unless otherwise specified, using any psionic ability requires somatic components and causes some sort of physical manifestation (e.g. a shimmer, glow, vibration, or smell) as the psion manipulates reality with their powers.

## Creating a Psion

### Quick Build

You can make a psion quickly by following these suggestions. First, Constitution should be your highest ability score. Second, choose the Servant of the Dyarchy background.

### Class Features

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per psion level. 

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier 

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per psion level after 1st.

As a Psion you wield psionic powers to generate a variety of effects. Your psychic energy ebbs and flows as you wield it. This ebb and flow is represented by your Psionic Energy (PE) die.

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor 

**Weapons:** simple, [daggers](dagger.md#), [rapiers](rapier.md#), [shortswords](shortsword.md#)

**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Wisdom 

**Skills:** choose two from Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, or Religion.

### Equipment

You begin play with the following equipment, in addition to any equipment provided by your background.

- (a) a shortsword or simple weapon, (b) two daggers
- (a) leather armor or (b) scale mail (if proficient)
- (a) a scholar's pack or (b) an explorer's pack

### Psionics

#### Psionic Energy Die

As a Psion you harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, as represented by your Psionic Energy die, the maximum size of which  at level 1 is a **d6**.

**Changing the Die's Size.** If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Energy die, it *decreases* by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it's a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Energy die, it *increases* by one die size after the roll, up to its initial base size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6.

Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Energy die resets to its maximum size. When you reach certain levels in this class, the maximum size of your Psionic Energy die increases: at 3rd level (d8), 9th level (d10), and 15th level (d12). You cannot have a PE die greater than a d12 or smaller than a d4. 

**Psi Replenishment.** As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Energy die to its maximum size. You can't use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.

#### Innate Psionics

Psionic powers, Psionic Talents, and spells gained through this class use your psionic ability.

Your abilities are determined by the Aptitudes and Talents you have chosen as you progress in this class. Constitution is your relevant ability for your talents. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier for Psionic abilities that require a saving throw or attack roll.

**Psion save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Consitution modifier

**Psion attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

#### Psi-Boosted Ability

At first level you can use your psionic powers to boost your abilities at crucial moments. When you make an ability check with the ability you've chosen to boost, you can roll your Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the check. You can choose to do so before or after rolling the d20, but it must be *before* you know whether the check succeeded or failed. You may use this power a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses after a short or long rest. 

#### Psi-Damaging Strike

Starting at first level you can use your psionic abilities to aid in damaging an enemy. When you hit with an attack roll, you can roll your Psionic Energy die after you make the damage roll and then *replace* one of the damage dice with the number rolled on the Psionic Energy die. The damage done from this die is *force* damage. 

#### Mental Discipline

Beginning at second level you can use your reaction to a psychic attack and become resistant to all psychic damage from that attacker until the end of their next turn. You also have advantage for that duration on all saving throws related to any attempt by the attacker to manipulate your mind (e.g. via command, geas, dominate, etc.) or subject you to a condition such as the charm, fear, or confusion. As a bonus action you can expend a Psionic Energy die size and *end* an effect on yourself subjecting you to one of those conditions. You may only end one effect per die size expended. 

#### Psionic Archetype

At third, fifth, ninth, and fifteenth levels you gain abilities specific to your psionic archetype.

#### Channel Life Force

At sixth level you may channel your life force into the expenditure of psychic energy. This may manifest in either of the following ways:

- **Psi Stamina Drain**. You can recharge your Psi Energy die to its maximum size but in doing so you gain 1 level of exhaustion.

- **Psi Life Conversion**. You may ignore the die reduction of a max roll on your psi die by sacrificing part of your physical resilience. Roll two hit dice and reduce your current and max HP by that amount (this consumes the hit dice). This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest and if your hit point maximum is reduced to 0 you drop unconscious until it is restored.

Each use beyond the first of this ability before a long rest doubles the negative effect, so, e.g., the second use of Psi Stamina Drain increases your exhaustion 2 levels and Psi Life Conversion would use 4 hit dice.

#### Empowered Psionics

At thirteenth level, when you deal psychic or force damage with a psychic attack (whether a talent or a spell), you can add your Constitution modifier to the damage against the attack's targets. This added damage is *psychic damage*.

#### Enhanced Innate Psionics

At eighteenth level you gain enhanced innate psionic powers. Once per short or long rest you can cast *one* of Dominate Person, Scrying, or Telekinesis, and do so without verbal, somatic, or material components. 

#### Embodied Mind

At twentieth level your body has fully become a physical manifestation of your psychic prowess. You have resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, poison, and force damage. You no longer age, and you are immune to disease. Moreover, you regain psychic energy more efficiently. You may reduce a level of exhaustion in a short rest. When expending hit-dice in a short rest, for each hit-die expended, you may roll your Psionic Energy die and add the result. Note that your PE die is subject to normal rules here concerning expansion or contraction of the die size. 

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th. 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Psionic Powers

Aptitudes are generic forms of the expression of psychic power. Each aptitude allows a character to engage in more specific forms of psychic activity called "talents". There are two classes of talents. "Major" talents are those that are specific to (and only accessible to those with) an aptitude. "Minor" talents are those talents that may be acquired regardless of aptitude. You gain aptitudes at levels 1, 8, and 17, and further major talents at levels 3, 8, 11, 14, and 18. Whenever you gain an aptitude, you can choose one talent from the new aptitude's list. 

Unless otherwise specified, the use of a major talent requires the expenditure of a PE die size. If you have no PE die sizes remaining then you cannot use the talent. 

### Minor Talents

At 1st level choose *two* minor talents from the following list. You gain one additional minor talent from the list at levels 4 and 10. Insofar as these minor talents relate to spells of the same name, they may be cast without verbal, somatic, or material components. However, exercise of such a talent still generates whatever effect is typical of the Psion's use of their psychic powers. Those minor talents that do not have a spell description, such as Psychic Whip, are described in further detail below. 

- Mind Sliver 
- Psychic Whip 
- Psychic Shield 
- ESP
- Psionic Wave
- Mental Rapport
- Blade Ward 
- Fire Bolt
- Friends 
- Guidance 
- Light 
- Mage Hand 
- Magic Stone 
- Message 
- Minor Illusion 
- Ray Of Frost
- Spare The Dying 
- Thaumaturgy 


#### Minor Talent Descriptions

Many minor talents mimic the effects of well-known spells. However, some are unique to the Psion. Below are several of these. Consult with your DM if you have ideas for a new minor talent. 

**Psychic Whip**: As a bonus action, you create a psychic whip that lashes out at a target within 30 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and be pulled up to 10 feet towards you. At 5th, 11th, and 17th level you deal an additional 1d4 of damage, up to a maximum of 4d4. 

**Psionic Wave**: As an action you release a wave of psionic force energy within a 5 ft. radius centered on you. Each creature in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Psion DC or take 1d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

**Psychic Shield**: As a reaction you create a shield of psionic energy that surrounds you or *another creature that you can see*. Pick *one* of the following benefits and roll your PE die. The reduction or benefit is equal to the value of the rolled die. The effect lasts until the end of your next turn. 

- Reduction of psychic damage.
- Bonus to any saves against divination magic or mental scan.
- Bonus to any save against a condition caused by enchantment magics from charm, confusion, fear, etc.

At 5th, 11th, 17th, and 20th level you may shield an additional creature that you can see, up to a maximum of five. 

**ESP**: As an action you can perceive any mind which is not protected or otherwise shielded against divination or psionic targeting within 50 feet. Any  creature within this area that fails a Wisdom saving throw will make its surface thoughts available to be understood regardless of language spoken. If the creature has an Intelligence of 3 or less it will transmit impressionistic "pictures" and/ or raw emotions and desires. Roll your PE die. The effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the die roll. A creature that is hidden from (or otherwise immune to) psionics or divination magic is immune to this feature.

**Mental Rapport**: As a bonus action you may communicate telepathically with one willing creature within 30 feet. The creature must be able to speak a language that you can understand. Otherwise only basic sensory images or feelings may be communicated. Any barriers of rock, wood, or metal thicker than a few inches will block your ability. A creature that has an intelligence score lower than 3, or is hidden from psionics or divination magic is immune to this feature.

### Aptitudes

There are five different aptitudes, each with their own distinctive major talents. These are scanning, sending, porting, transmuting, nullifying, and energizing. Each aptitude has its own distinctive talents. These are described below. Note that, unless otherwise indicated, the exercise of a talent counts as an action. 

#### Scanning ####

The *scanning* aptitude allows the psion to gain information from the world around them. Such information might include the emotions or thoughts of others, enhanced perception of the environment, or even allow one to experience the world through another's mind.

##### Empathic Insight #####

As an action, you can empathically read a creature that you can see within 60 feet. You learn its most powerful surface-level emotion. For example, you might learn that a creature is excited, fearful, angry, sad, or content. Whenever you make a Charisma check to interact with a creature whose aura you have read, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

You can also use this power to detect the presence of sentient creatures you can't see. As an action, you can search for creatures within 15 feet of you. Any barriers of rock, wood, or metal thicker than a few inches will block your ability. A creature that is not sentient, explicitly does not experience emotions, is hidden from psionics, divination magic, or having their mind read is immune to this feature.

##### Mind Reading

You can use your telepathic abilities to read the thoughts of another creature. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Psion spell save DC. On a failed save, you can read the surface thoughts of the creature for a number of minutes equal to the value of a roll of your PE die. 

You can also use this power to detect the presence of intelligent creatures you can't see. As an action, you can search for creatures within 15 feet of you. Any barriers of rock, wood, or metal thicker than a few inches will block your ability. A creature that has an intelligence score lower than 3, does not possess any language, is hidden from psionics, divination magic, or otherwise having their mind read is immune to this feature.

##### Psychometry #####

You can make relevant inferences from an object of unknown history by making physical contact with that object. When used as an action, you gain a bonus equal to your Constitution modifier on Investigation or History rolls with respect to an object you can touch. If you succeed on your ability check you can gain specific information about the identity, appearance, or mental state of the creature or creatures that most recently handled the item. or were most significantly related to its creation or history.

##### Amodal Cognition #####

You gain information about your environment without it coming to you via any sense modality. Instead you simply "know" various facts concerning your location or the creatures occupying it. Whenever you make an Insight or Investigation check  you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1). This applies only to a location, item, or creature within five feet of you. To extend the range of your cognition you must use an action, and expend one PE die size per 10 feet of range. The extended range lasts ten minutes, or until you lose concentration, whichever is shorter. Known information can include the name, owner, location, alignment, emotional valence, and even (surface level) thoughts, of objects or creatures in range. 

##### Third Eye #####

You see as if through a third eye, which grants you enhanced sight in a 10-foot radius with you at the center. Within this range you have blindsight and can see into the ethereal plane. As an action, you can expend a PE die size and expand the radius of your enhanced sight by 10 feet per point rolled on the PE die.

While seeing through your third eye you also gain proficiency in Perception, and whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

##### Remote Viewing #####

You can see and hear events occurring at a location within range as if you were there, even if you have never been to that location before. As an action, you can choose a location that you know exists and is within a number of miles equal to your PE die size. For the next 10 minutes, you can see and hear everything happening at that location, as if you were standing there yourself. You can move your point of view around the location as if you were physically present. However, you cannot interact with anything at the location or communicate with any creatures there. You must concentrate to maintain this ability, and you cannot move or take other actions while using it.

##### Precognition #####

You gain a premonition of future events. As an action, you can roll your PE die and add the result to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make within the next minute. You can use this talent once per long rest without expending any PE die size. If you use this more than once per long rest you must expend a PE die size for every use until you take a long rest. 

##### Retrocognition #####

You can sense information about past events that occurred in your current location or nearby. As an action, you can roll your PE die and learn information about an event that took place within the area you can see or touch, up to a number of years equal to the number rolled. The information you receive is based on the nature of the event and the degree of its significance. For example, you might learn the identity of a person who was recently in the area, the location of a hidden object, or the details of a past battle. You cannot use this talent to gain information about events that occurred beyond the range of your senses or that you have no way of accessing. You can use this talent a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus.

#### Sending ####

The *sending* aptitude allows the psion to project psychic energy or information they possess into the world around them. Such information might include emotions or thoughts, allowing communication or influence of a creature's mind, similarly the sending might alter a creature's perception of its environment. The sending aptitude also allows a Psion to engage in various kinds of mental attack, as they project their psyche into another's mind.

##### Communion

You may communicate your emotions or thoughts to the mind of another intelligent being that you can immediately perceive. The recipient recognizes these emotions or thoughts as not their own, and may make an Intelligence check to determine their source. This talent effectively allows one-way communication between sender and recipient. The communion lasts 1 hour per PE die size expended. After the communion is established the recipient need no longer be within immediate perceptual range. Communion with the recipient is a free action, though it requires concentration to maintain. 

Any barriers of rock, wood, or metal thicker than a few inches will block your ability. A creature that has an intelligence score lower than 3, does not possess any language, is hidden from psionics or divination magic is immune to this feature.

##### Intrusion #####

You can use your psychic energy to send intrusive thoughts to a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see or otherwise know the exact location of. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your psion DC or take 1d6 + PE die roll of *psychic* damage, and become frightened for a number of rounds equal to the PE roll (minimum of 1). On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not frightened. You can use this talent once per short rest.

##### Mind Link

*Prerequisite: either Communion or Mind Reading* 

You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As an action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to *twice* your proficiency bonus, and then roll your Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common language to understand each other. 

##### Mind Hammer

As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d10 psychic damage per PE die spent and suffers disadvantage on its next Wisdom saving throw before the end of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and suffer no disadvantage.

##### Mind Blast #####

You expend two PE die sizes to project a blast of psychic energy in a 30-foot cone in front of you. Each creature in the cone must make a Wisdom saving throw or take (3d8 + Consitution modifier) of psychic damage and be [[Stunned|Stunned]] for 1 round. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not stunned. Add 1d8 of additional psychic damage at levels 5, 12, and 18. 

##### Mind Meld #####

You link your mind with that of another creature you can touch. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Psionics save DC or become charmed by you for one hour or until it takes damage. While the creature is charmed in this way, you can communicate with it telepathically. You may use this talent once per long rest.

##### Psychic Command #####

You attempt to charm a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Psionics save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is under your control and you can issue it simple commands, such as "Approach," "Flee," "Halt," or "Drop what you're holding." The creature will not obey any commands that might cause it harm. Once the effect ends, the creature becomes aware of your control and can take actions against you if it wishes.

##### Psionic Disguise #####

You can use your psionic power to alter your appearance. As an action, you can alter your physical appearance in any way you choose, as if you had cast the Disguise Self spell. The effect lasts for up to 1 hour, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses after a long rest.

##### Mental Insinuation #####

You subtly insinuate your preferences to another, and thus influence their choices, without ever overtly making your influence noticed. While concentrating on this talent you gain expertise in the Persuasion skill, though you have only normal proficiency against creatures that are resistant or immune to mental influence or charm (such as a creature under the effect of *mind blank*).

##### Psychic Presence #####

You project a psionic aura that can either draw or repel attention from others. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Psionic save DC or be drawn to you for the next minute, as if by a Charm Person spell. Alternatively, you can choose to repel the creature, causing it to make an immediate Wisdom saving throw against your Psionic save DC or be unable to approach within 30 feet of you for the next minute. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses after a long rest.

##### Mental Image #####

You gain the ability to project images into the minds of creatures with perfect clarity, interposing it over their reality. Creatures affected by this talent must make an Intelligence saving throw or be convinced that the image is real, even if it contradicts other sensory input. The image lasts for up to 10 minutes, until your concentration is interrupted, or until you choose (bonus action) to end it. You can target up to three creatures with this talent at once, and must have a clear line of sight to them. You may use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before need a short or long rest. Additionally, you can spend an action and a number of PE die sizes up to your proficiency bonus to make the image more vivid, increasing the DC of the saving throw by the result of the lowest level of the PE die. 

##### Phantom Idea

Required time: 1 hour

Requires concentration 

Cost: 1 PE die 

While you concentrate on this ability, you probe one creature's mind. The creature must remain within 30 feet of you, and you must be able to see or otherwise immediately perceive it. If you reach the ability's full duration, the target must make three Intelligence saving throws, and you plant a memory or an idea in it, which lasts for a number of hours based on the number of saving throws it fails. You choose whether the idea or memory is trivial (such as "I had porridge for breakfast" or "Ale is the worst") or personality-defining ("I failed to save my village from orc marauders and am therefore a coward" or "Magic is a scourge, so I renounce it"). With one failed saving throw, the idea or memory lasts for the next 4 hours. With two failed saving throws, it lasts for 24 hours. With three failed saving throws, it lasts for 48 hours.

#### Porting ####

The portal is a circular opening that is 5 feet in diameter, and it lasts for up to 1 minute, unless it is dismissed (bonus action) or your concentration is interrupted. Any creature or object that enters the portal from either side is immediately transported to the other side of the portal, appearing in an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of the portal. The portal can be used up to three times before it disappears.

##### Teleport #####

You teleport yourself and any creatures you choose within 30 feet of you to an unoccupied space you can see within 1 mile. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet." You may do this once per long rest. If you teleport a number of creatures (or objects of medium or larger size) greater than your proficiency bonus you must take a level of exhaustion.

# Psion Subclasses

There are three subclasses from which one can choose as a Psion: Wilder, Tactician, and Inquisitor. In addition to these subclasses there are other classes that themselves have psionic subclasses, such as the Fighter (Psi-Warrior), Rogue (Soul-Blade), and Sorcerer (Aberrant Mind). Each of the subclasses below is distinctive to Ermis and/or the Dyarchy, though they may be generalized to any setting. 

Note that apart from the Wilder subclass, choice of subclass requires having particular aptitudes. 

## Subclass: Anomia (Wilder)

Anomia are powerful psions that lack any formal training. Their abilities can vary, and their use can sometimes be unpredictable. But they tend to make up for their lack of formal training with unusual abilities and a ferociousness of mind. The Wilder subclass has its choice of the aptitudes. 

#### Wild Surge

*3rd level feature*

As a bonus action, you can enter a state of wild energy, gaining temporary hit points equal to your psion level + your Constitution modifier. While in this state, any time you use a psionic talent, you can choose to trigger a wild surge. Roll a d20, and on a roll of 1, you suffer a psychic backlash, taking psychic damage equal to your psion level and losing any remaining temporary hit points from this feature. On a roll of 2-9, your wild surge causes a minor psychic disturbance, granting you advantage on your next psionic talent before the end of your next turn. On a roll of 10-19, your wild surge causes a major psychic disturbance, causing one additional target to be affected by your psionic talent, if applicable. On a roll of 20, your wild surge causes a catastrophic psychic disturbance, causing the effects of your psionic talent to be maximized, or in the case of a damaging talent, to deal maximum damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses after a long rest.

#### Psychic Feedback

*5th level feature*

Whenever you take damage, you can use your reaction to send a burst of psychic energy back at your attacker. The attacker must make an Intelligence saving throw with a DC equal to your Psion DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes psychic damage equal to half the damage you took (minimum of 1) and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the attacker takes a quarter of the original damage and is not stunned. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

#### Unpredictable Power

*9th level feature*

You can now use your Wild Surge feature as a reaction when you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, before the outcome of the roll is determined. Roll a d20, and on a roll of 1, the creature automatically fails the roll and suffers a psychic backlash, taking psychic damage equal to your psion level and losing any remaining temporary hit points from your Wild Surge feature. On a roll of 2-9, the creature gains advantage on the roll. On a roll of 10-19, the creature gains advantage and can roll an additional d4 to add to the roll. On a roll of 20, the creature succeeds automatically, and its success is maximized. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses after a long rest.

Each creature in the area must make an Intelligence saving throw with a DC equal to your psion DC, taking psychic damage equal to 10d8 on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, on a failed save, each creature must roll a d6 and subtract the result from all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws it makes until the end of its next turn. You can use this feature once per long rest.

## Subclass: Polytaktos (Tactician)

Highly strategic and tactical thinkers, Polytaktoi are trained to account for every apparent contingency, as well as to adapt to every situation. They do not typically find themselves in battle but largely because their plans to not require them to.

#### Contingency Plan

*3rd level feature*

As a bonus action, you can create a contingency plan for yourself or an ally within 60 feet. The plan can be activated at any time before the end of your next turn, and triggers automatically when a specific condition you specify is met (such as "when an enemy enters a designated area", "when an ally takes damage from a specific type of attack", etc.). The contingency plan can have various effects, such as granting temporary hit points, teleporting the target to safety, granting advantage on an attack, or causing a specific spell to be cast. You can create a number of contingency plans equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of this feature after a long rest.

#### Adaptive Tactics

*5th level feature*

Whenever you or an ally within 60 feet of you successfully hits a creature with an attack, you can use your reaction to grant them an extra benefit based on the type of attack. If the attack was a melee attack, the target's speed is reduced by half until the end of its next turn. If the attack was a ranged attack, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn. If the attack was a spell attack, the target has disadvantage on its next saving throw before the end of its next turn.

#### Master Strategist

*9th level feature*

You gain proficiency in the Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Insight) skills, as well as expertise in one Intelligence-based skill of your choice.

#### Lie Detector

*3rd-level Psionic Talent*

You can tell when any creature with whom you are communicating by telepathy is lying to you. 

#### Mind Probe

*3rd-level Psionic Talent*

While similar to ESP, a probe targets a single individual within 30 feet of the Psion, and permits much deeper access to a target's mind. If the target fails a Wisdom save all of their memories and knowledge become (in principle) accessible via questioning. The Psion may ask one question per round (any additional questions require expending an PE die size) which the target must reply truthfully or reply with "I don't know." However, if the question or answer becomes too complicated, the DM may require more than 1 round to complete the action, allow the target an additional Wisdom save, or simply deny the request. The target need not be conscious for this ability to work. The use of this ability requires the Psion's concentration for the duration of the inquiry. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.

#### Mind Lock

*5th-level Psionic Talent*

Mind Lock is a kind of psychic manipulation that renders inaccessible to any but the Psion a portion of the target's mind. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw to avoid this effect. If the saving throw fails, the wipe has been successful, making the knowledge in that part of the target's mind inaccessible, and reducing the target's intelligence and Wisdom scores by 1 point each. This can affect everything from languages known, to spells which may be cast. This memory loss is permanent unless restored by the Psion or through a wish or similar spell. This ability may cumulatively affect a target down to a minimum intelligence or Wisdom score of 3. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.

#### Psychic Profiling

*9th-level Psionic Talent*

You gain exceptional insight concerning any individual or creature whom you have previously detected via any other scanning or minor talent.

For purposes of this talent, "exceptional insight" includes a name, a mental image of the subject, the subject's alignment, and the subject's location (an image of the subject's current location that is, e.g., good enough to teleport to if studied carefully). Powers, special abilities, and spells do not protect against you profiling ability, not even Mind Blank or spells such as Wish.  You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.

#### Telepathic Mastery

*15th-level Psionic Talent*

You have gained mastery over your telepathic abilities. You can use your Mind Link talent to communicate telepathically with any creature that you can immediately perceive, regardless of their distance from you. You can also use your Probe Thoughts talent on any creature you have previously probed thoughts from, regardless of how long ago it was. Finally, when you use your Mind Meld talent, you can choose to expend your Psionic Energy die to increase the duration of the effect by a number of hours equal to the die's size. Additionally, the target creature takes psychic damage equal to twice your Psionic Energy die if it fails its Intelligence saving throw at the end of the effect. You may choose to have it automatically succeed its save.  You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.
