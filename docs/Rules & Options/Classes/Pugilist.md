# Class: Pugilist

![[../../assets/img/pugilist.jpeg|pugilist.jpeg]]

The pugilist is a martial class in D&D focused on unarmed fighting. Pugilists tap into an inner resolve called moxie which fuels their special abilities. They excel at bare-knuckle brawling, taking hits, and overcoming odds stacked against them.

Pugilists are proficient with simple weapons, whips, improvised weapons, and light armor. Their key abilities are Strength and Constitution. At early levels, they gain features like Iron Chin to use Constitution for AC and Fisticuffs to deal improved unarmed damage. 

As they gain experience, pugilists unlock moxie abilities powered by moxie points. These include Brace Up to gain temporary HP, Old One-Two to make bonus action strikes, and Stick and Move to shove or dash as a bonus action.

At 3rd level, a pugilist joins a Fight Club which provides subclass features. These include Arena Royale for showmanship, Bloodhound Bruisers for urban vigilantism, and The Sweet Science for elegant boxing techniques. 

Other pugilist features improve their resilience like Bloodied but Unbowed to gain resources when reduced to half health and School of Hard Knocks for psychic resistance. Their capstone ability Peak Physical Condition raises Strength and Constitution to 22.

Overall, the pugilist is great for players wanting a scrappy brawler who uses their force of will to overcome challenges and never stays down for long. Their mix of bruiser tactics and showy bravado make them a unique martial class.
