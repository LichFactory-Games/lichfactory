All of the following domains are available to the clerics of Er, but there is only one god -- Er itself. Eligible domains for the clerics of Er are: Arcana Domain, Death Domain, Knowledge Domain, Life Domain, Light Domain, Nature Domain, Order Domain, Peace Domain. There is also a new domain, the Power Domain.

### Power Domain

The Clerics of Er have access to an additional domain characteristic of their monotheism -- a domain that springs from the Erimaen conception of all things as existing in virtue of striving to preserve and promote their power. Since this notion of "power" is fundamental to *all* beings, it is the primary manner in which all of existence manifests. Clerics of the Power Domain focus on the promotion of life, the freedom from external constraints or conditions, and the connection of each being's existence to that of others and the fate of all.

| Cleric Level | Spells                         |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| 1st          | guiding bolt, sanctuary        |
| 3rd          | lesser restoration, zone of truth |
| 5th          | aura of vitality, clairvoyance |
| 7th          | aura of purity, divination     |
| 9th          | greater restoration, legend lore |

### Bonus Cantrip

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the [[guidance|Guidance]] cantrip, if you do not already know it.

### Imbue with Power

At 1st level, the Power Domain grants the ability to use a bonus action to imbue a weapon with divine energy, dealing an extra 1d8 damage additional damage of the same type as the weapon on a hit. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

Additionally, the Cleric can designate a creature that will gain advantage on attack rolls or saving throws until the end of the Cleric's next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Powerful Portents

At 2nd level, you can intuit aspects of the future in everyday objects and events, such as flights of birds or ripples made in water by a thrown stone. You can cast the Augury spell without expending a spell slot and, when you cast the spell in this way, the spell has no verbal, somatic, or material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

In addition, until you finish a long rest, when you cast a divination spell that includes a chance the DM gives you either no answer or a random reading---such as Augury, Commune, or Divination---reduce that chance by 25 percent.

### Potent Freedom

At 6th level you gain the ability to use a bonus action to grant yourself or an ally a fly speed equal to their walking speed for 1 minute. Additionally, the Cleric can use their Channel Divinity to end a condition (except those that require a wish spell or similar level of power) affecting themselves or an ally.

### Potent Force

At 8th-level you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. Additionally, you gain resistance to force damage.

### Potent Command

At 17th level, you gain the ability to channel your divine power into a commanding presence. As an action, you may make any creature(s) of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you roll a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they are charmed by you for 1 hour or until they take damage. While charmed, they will follow your commands to the best of their ability. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
