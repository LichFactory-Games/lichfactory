# Familiars

*Source: Monster Manual p. 347* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [find familiar](find-familiar.md#) spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [crawling claw](crawling-claw.md#), an [imp](imp.md#), a [pseudodragon](pseudodragon.md#), or a [quasit](quasit.md#).
