**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 1 minute

For the duration, you can move through difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain, and you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can jump up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) times your normal jump distance.

## Force Pull

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self, 15-foot radius  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small sphere of iron)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You manipulate the gravitational forces within a 15-foot radius sphere centered on yourself. The area becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than you, and each creature other than you that starts its turn within the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have its speed halved until the start of its next turn. Additionally, ranged weapon attacks made into or out of the area are made at disadvantage.

## Repulsive Force Bolt

*3rd-level kinemancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

## Weightless Field

*4th-level kinemancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self, 30-foot radius
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an area of low gravity within a 30-foot radius sphere centered on yourself. For the duration, creatures, objects, and structures within the area are affected as if by the feather fall spell. Additionally, creatures within the area can jump up to three times their normal distance and can move through difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain.

## Gravity Flux

*4th-level kinemancy*  

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of lead)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an area of gravitational flux centered on a point you can see within range. The area is a 20-foot radius sphere. Creatures within the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled towards the center of the sphere, where they become restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to escape. Additionally, any creature that starts its turn restrained by the spell takes 2d8 force damage.

## Antigravity Field

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self, 20-foot radius
**Components:** V, S, M (a vial of mercury)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an antigravity field centered on yourself, which lasts for the duration. Any creatures, objects, or liquids within the area of effect that aren't secured to a solid surface are affected by the field, and will begin to float and drift upward at a rate of 60 feet per round. While in the field, creatures can move themselves by pushing off of objects or other creatures, and can move at their normal speed in any direction. They can also choose to fall by intentionally moving downward, but otherwise will continue to float until the spell ends or they exit the field. When the spell ends, affected creatures and objects gently descend to the ground.

## Spatial Distortion

*1st-level orimancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self, 15-foot radius
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You distort the space around you, causing the area within the radius to become difficult terrain for all creatures other than you. Additionally, any ranged attacks or spells made into or out of the area are at disadvantage.

## Temporal Echo

*1st-level orimancy*   

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an echo of yourself that lasts for the duration. As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can swap places with the echo, allowing you to move up to your movement speed as part of the swap.

## Spatial Compression

*2nd-level orimancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of obsidian)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You compress your physical form, causing you to occupy half the space you normally would. You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

## Time Slip

*3rd-level orimancy*  

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You slip out of time for a brief moment, gaining a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. Additionally, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed when an attack is made against you.

## Spatial Rift

*4th-level orimancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of mica)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a rift in space at a point you can see within range. Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the rift must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 force damage and be pushed 10 feet away from the rift. A successful save halves the damage and negates the push.

## Time Lock

*5th-level orimancy*  

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pocket watch) 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You lock a creature or object in time, causing it to be unable to move or take any actions for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.

## Spatial Anchor

*6th-level orimancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self, 30-foot radius
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a field of spatial distortion around you that anchors objects and creatures in place. Any creature that attempts to move more than 5 feet within the radius must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of its turn. Additionally, objects and structures within the radius have their movement speed halved.

## Time Reversal

*7th-level orimancy* 

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet 
**Components:** V, S, M (an hourglass filled with black sand)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You reverse time for a brief moment, causing a creature or object within range to revert to its state from a previous round. Choose a target creature or object within range that you can see. You can rewind time up to 6 seconds, effectively causing the target to undo their last action, or the state of the object to revert to a previous state. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target returns to its previous state; on a successful save, nothing happens. The effects of this spell cannot be used to reverse death or the effects of other spells that have permanent or long-lasting effects.  

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 7th.

## Spatial Swap

*8th-level orimancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (two small mirrors or other highly reflective pieces)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You swap the positions of two creatures or objects within range. Both targets must be willing or must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target resists the swap and the spell fails. On a successful save, the targets swap places, exchanging their positions. If either target cannot occupy the other's space, the spell fails. The targets retain their orientation and any objects they are carrying or wearing. If a target is unwilling or unable to move, the spell fails.

## Time Freeze

*9th-level orimancy*  

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self, 30-foot radius   
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp, consumed)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You freeze time within a 30-foot radius sphere centered on you. All creatures and objects within the area are frozen in time for the duration. While time is frozen, no time passes for the affected creatures or objects, and they are unaware of their surroundings. The duration of this spell is subjective and is measured from the perspective of creatures and objects outside the area. Spells and other effects that have a duration longer than the remaining duration of Time Freeze are suspended and resume their effects once the spell ends. The caster can choose to end the spell before its duration expires. Additionally, if a creature or object is moved from the area while time is frozen, it remains unaffected by the spell.
