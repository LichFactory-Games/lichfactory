The cloaked figure stood amidst a bustling marketplace, their eyes closed in deep concentration. With a gentle sweep of their hand, the figure extended their consciousness beyond the physical realm, delving into the thoughts and emotions of those nearby. The hustle and bustle of the market faded into whispers as they effortlessly read the minds of the crowd, discerning secrets and desires. Knowledge was their weapon in navigating this intricate web of minds, their insights guiding their every move in this world of hidden intentions.

The young woman fled into the forest, consumed with the terror of what she had done. For as long as she could remember, there was something within her mind that she struggled to keep bottled up. That morning, in a moment of weakness, her focus slipped, and a torrent of wild psionic power erupted from within her. She had awoken in the rubble of her home to find her family buried in the ruins. Deep down, she had always known this power would break free.

### Creating Your Psion

When creating your Psion, consider how you first discovered and manifested your psychic abilities. Was it in your youth during a moment of intense emotion? Perhaps you first expressed your power through peaceful meditation? Perhaps you were trained from birth to be initiated into a powerful psychic society.

Consider whether you have studied with a psionic master or merely learned on your own to manipulate the psychic powers you find within.

How do you feel about your psionic gift? Is it a point of great pride? Something that separates you from the commoners? Or, do you view your gift as a curse to be hidden and used in the direst situations?

#### Quick Build

You can make a Psion quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom or Dexterity. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the Psi Bolt and ESP minor talents.

## Class Features

### Psionics (Level 1)

Your have psionic abilities. The psionic energy that you possess is represented by your Psionic Energy Die (PE die). The powers that you have in virtue of this psionic energy are determined by the Aptitudes and Talents you have chosen as you progress in this class. Psionics is distinct from magic, though it shares in some of its effects.

#### Psionic Energy Die

As a Psion you harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, as represented by your Psionic Energy die, the starting size of which at level 1 is  `1d4`.

Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Energy die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this class, the starting size of your Psionic Energy die increases: at 2nd level (`d6`), 5th level (`d8`), 11th level (`d10`), and 17th level (`d12`).

**Changing the Die's Size.** If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Energy die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a `d6` and you roll a 6, it becomes a `d4`. If it's a `d4` and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.

Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Energy die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its initial size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a `d4`, the die then becomes a `d6`. Your PE die can never increase in size beyond your level's initial starting size.

#### Psionic Aptitudes

Aptitudes are generic forms of the expression of psychic power. Each aptitude allows a character to engage in more specific forms of psychic activity called 'talents'. There are five different aptitudes, each with their own distinctive major talents. These are Scanning, Sending, Porting, Changing, Nullifying, and Energizing. Each aptitude has its own distinctive talents. You gain aptitudes at levels 3, 8, and 17. The Psion progression table shows the total number of aptitudes you have at each level.

#### Psionic Talents

While aptitudes are generic forms of the expression of psychic power, each aptitude allows a character to engage in more specific forms of psychic activity called 'talents'. There are two classes of talents. 'Major' talents are those that are specific to (and only accessible to those with) an aptitude. 'Minor' talents are those talents that may be acquired *regardless* of aptitude. You begin with two minor talents.

Major talents are acquired at levels 3, 8, 11, 14, and 18. You cannot choose a major talent unless you have the relevant aptitude. Also, unless otherwise specified, the use of a major talent requires the expenditure of a PE die size. If you have no PE die sizes remaining then you cannot use the major talent.

#### Psionic Ability

Constitution is your ability for your psionic powers, since the source of your power comes from the strength of your lifeforce. You use your Constitution whenever an exercise of your psionic power refers to your psionic ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic talent or a spell whose effects you recreate with your psionic abilities, and when making an attack roll that uses a psionic ability.

**Spell save DC**: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

**Spell attack modifier**: your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

### Psi-Boosted Ability (Level 1)

At 1st level, you can use your psionic powers to boost your abilities. You can roll your Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to an ability check with the chosen ability. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses after a short or long rest.

### Psi-Damaging Strike (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, when you hit with an attack roll, you can roll your Psionic Energy die and replace one of the damage dice with the number rolled on the die. You can wait to do this until *after* you've rolled the original attack damage. The damage from you PED strike is **force** damage.

### Minor Talent (Level 1)

'Minor' talents are those talents that may be acquired *regardless* of aptitude. You being with two minor talents. You gain an additional minor talent at levels 4 and 10.

### Mental Discipline (Level 2)

At 2nd level, you can use your reaction to a psychic attack and become resistant to all psychic damage from that attacker until the end of their next turn. You also have advantage on saving throws against attempts to manipulate your mind or subject you to conditions such as charm, fear, or confusion. As a bonus action, you can expend a Psionic Energy die size to end one effect on yourself that subjects you to a condition.

### Psionic Archetype (Level 3)

Choose a psionic archetype. At 3rd, 5th, 9th, and 15th levels, you gain abilities specific to your psionic archetype.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Psionic Archetype Feature (Level 5)

You gain abilities specific to your psionic archetype.

### Channel Life Force (Level 6)

At sixth level you may channel your life force into the expenditure of psychic energy. This may manifest in either of the following ways:

- **Psi Stamina Drain.** You can recharge your Psi Energy die to its maximum size but in doing so you gain 1 level of exhaustion.  
- **Psi Life Conversion.** You may ignore the die reduction of a max roll on your psi die by sacrificing part of your physical resilience. Roll two hit dice and reduce your current and max HP by that amount (this consumes the hit dice). This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest and if your hit point maximum is reduced to 0 you drop unconscious until it is restored.  

Each use beyond the first of this ability before a long rest doubles the negative effect, so, e.g., the second use of Psi Stamina Drain increases your exhaustion 2 levels and Psi Life Conversion would use 4 hit dice.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 7)

When you reach 7th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Psionic Archetype Feature (Level 9)

You gain abilities specific to your psionic archetype.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 10)

When you reach 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 12)

When you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Empowered Psionics (Level 13)

At 13th level, when you deal psychic or force damage with a psychic attack, you can add your Constitution modifier to the damage against the attack's targets.

### Psionic Archetype Feature (Level 15)

You gain abilities specific to your psionic archetype.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 16)

When you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Enhanced Innate Psionics (Level 18)

At eighteenth level you gain enhanced innate psionic powers. Once per short or long rest you can cast one of Dominate Person, Scrying, or Telekinesis, and do so without verbal, somatic, or material components.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 19)

When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Embodied Mind (Level 20)

At twentieth level your body has fully become a physical manifestation of your psychic prowess. You have resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, poison, and force damage. You no longer age, and you are immune to disease. Moreover, you regain psychic energy more efficiently. You may reduce a level of exhaustion in a short rest. When expending hit-dice in a short rest, for each hit-die expended, you may roll your Psionic Energy die and add the result. Note that your PE die is subject to normal rules here concerning expansion or contraction of the die size.
