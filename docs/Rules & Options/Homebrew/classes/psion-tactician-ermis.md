## Class Features

### Tactician (Level 1)

Highly strategic and tactical thinkers, Tacticians are trained to account for every apparent contingency, as well as to adapt to every situation. They do not typically find themselves in battle but largely because their plans to not require them to. The Tactician must choose at least two aptitudes from scanning, sending, porting, and nullifying. The Tactician may not have an aptitude in changing.

### Contingency Plan (Level 3)

As a bonus action, you can create a contingency plan for yourself or an ally within 60 feet. The plan can be activated at any time before the end of your next turn and triggers automatically when a specific condition you specify is met (such as 'when an enemy enters a designated area', 'when an ally takes damage from a specific type of attack', etc.). The contingency plan can have various effects, such as granting temporary hit points, teleporting the target to safety, granting advantage on an attack, or causing a specific spell to be cast. You can create a number of contingency plans equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of this feature after a long rest.

### Adaptive Tactics (Level 5)

Whenever you or an ally within 60 feet of you successfully hits a creature with an attack, you can use your reaction to grant them an extra benefit based on the type of attack. If the attack was a melee attack, the target's speed is reduced by half until the end of its next turn. If the attack was a ranged attack, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn. If the attack was a spell attack, the target has disadvantage on its next saving throw before the end of its next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

### Master Strategist (Level 9)

You gain proficiency in the Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Insight) skills, as well as expertise in one Intelligence-based skill of your choice. In addition, whenever you roll initiative, you can use your reaction to grant yourself and all allies within 60 feet of you advantage on their initiative rolls. You can use this feature once per long rest.

### Flawless Execution (Level 15)

When you or an ally within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant them a bonus to the roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). If the roll still fails, you can choose whether to expend a PE die to have the creature treat the roll as if it had succeeded instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses after a long rest.
