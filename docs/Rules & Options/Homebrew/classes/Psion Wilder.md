## Class Features

### Wilder (Level 3)

Wilders  are powerful psions that lack any formal training. Their abilities can vary, and their use can sometimes be unpredictable. But they tend to make up for their lack of formal training with unusual abilities and a ferociousness of mind. The Wilder subclass has its choice of the aptitudes.

### Wild Surge (Level 3)

Allows you to gain temporary hit points and trigger a wild surge when using a psionic talent. The wild surge can have various effects based on a d20 roll, including advantage, additional targets, or maximizing damage.

### Psychic Feedback (Level 5)

Lets you send a burst of psychic energy back at attackers when you take damage, potentially causing them to take damage and be stunned.

### Unpredictable Power (Level 9)

Allows you to use your Wild Surge as a reaction to influence the outcome of attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws made by yourself or a creature within 30 feet.

### Psychic Eruption (Level 15)

Allows you to unleash a psychic eruption, damaging all creatures within a 60-foot radius and imposing penalties on their rolls.
