## Class Features

### Kinemancer (Level 2)

Kinemancers are experts in manipulating attractive and repulsive force. They can shape and bend forces both within and without an object, causing objects to float, fall, or even orbit around them. Their powers allow them to control the battlefield, manipulating the movement of their enemies and allies alike. They also play an integral role on Ermis in settlement and construction.

### Forceful Movement (Level 2)

Your ability to control attractive and repulsive forces manifests itself in your physical activities. Any ability check that would normally rely on Strength can use Intelligence instead. You also gain proficiency in Athletics; use your Intelligence for all proficiency checks with this skill.

### Dynamic Step (Level 2)

You have the ability to dynamically vary the forces affecting you as you move. Until the end of your next turn, you can move through difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain, and you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can jump up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) times your normal jump distance. You may use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to take a short or long rest.

### Shape Force (Level 2)

You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your kinemancy or force-related spells. When you cast a kinemancy or any force-related spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no force damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Forceful Spellcasting (Level 6)

All force-related spells receive a bonus to damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, any spell attack that targets one creature can now force them to make a strength roll against your spell DC to either be pushed or pulled up to 5 feet per spell level. At level 15, this can also be applied to area-of-effect spells.

### Field of Force (Level 10)

You gain the at-will ability to manipulate fields of force as specified by the spell Wall of Force. You also have a +2 bonus to saving throws for maintaining concentration for this spell. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again unless you expend a spell slot of any level equal to or greater than 1 (higher level slots have no extra effect), or until you finish a long rest.

### Singularity (Level 14)

As an action, you can create a singular point of attractive force at a location you can see within 120 feet of you, and which lasts for 1 minute or until you lose concentration. The area becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than you (and any creatures you specify via Shape Force). Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the singularity must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage and is pulled 10 feet towards the singularity. Additionally, its speed is halved until the start of its next turn, and ranged weapon attacks made into or out of the area are made at disadvantage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pulled. However, it still suffers the effects of difficult terrain and disadvantage on ranged attacks. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
