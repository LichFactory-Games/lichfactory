## Class Features

### Inquisitor (Level 3)

The Inquisitor is a master of scanning and sending. They can capture information from another and send it to whomever needs it. An Inquisitor must choose the scanning and sending aptitudes. It's third aptitude is elective.

### Lie Detector (Level 3)

You can tell when any creature with whom you are communicating by telepathy is lying to you.

### Mind Probe (Level 3)

While similar to ESP, a probe targets a single individual within 30 feet of the Psion, and permits much deeper access to a target's mind. If the target fails a Wisdom save all of their memories and knowledge become (in principle) accessible via questioning. The Psion may ask one question per round (any additional questions require expending an PE die size) which the target must reply truthfully or reply with "I don't know." However, if the question or answer becomes too complicated, the DM may require more than 1 round to complete the action, allow the target an additional Wisdom save, or simply deny the request. The target need not be conscious for this ability to work. The use of this ability requires the Psion's concentration for the duration of the inquiry. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.

### Mind Lock (Level 5)

Mind Lock is a kind of psychic manipulation that renders inaccessible to any but the Psion a portion of the target's mind. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw to avoid this effect. If the saving throw fails, the wipe has been successful, making the knowledge in that part of the target's mind inaccessible, and reducing the target's intelligence and Wisdom scores by 1 point each. This can affect everything from languages known, to spells which may be cast. This memory loss is permanent unless restored by the Psion or through a wish or similar spell. This ability may cumulatively affect a target down to a minimum intelligence or Wisdom score of 3. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.

### Psychic Profiling (Level 9)

You gain exceptional insight concerning any individual or creature whom you have previously detected via any other scanning or minor talent.

For purposes of this talent, "exceptional insight" includes a name, a mental image of the subject, the subject's alignment, and the subject's location (an image of the subject's current location that is, e.g., good enough to teleport to if studied carefully). Powers, special abilities, and spells do not protect against your profiling ability, not even Mind Blank or spells such as Wish. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.

### Telepathic Mastery (Level 15)

You have gained mastery over your telepathic abilities. You can use your Mind Link talent to communicate telepathically with any creature that you can immediately perceive, regardless of their distance from you. You can also use your Probe Thoughts talent on any creature you have previously probed thoughts from, regardless of how long ago it was. Finally, when you use your Mind Meld talent, you can choose to expend your Psionic Energy die to increase the duration of the effect by a number of hours equal to the die's size. Additionally, the target creature takes psychic damage equal to twice your Psionic Energy die if it fails its Intelligence saving throw at the end of the effect. You may choose to have it automatically succeed its save. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.
