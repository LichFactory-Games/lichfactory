## Class Features

### Wilder (Level 1)

Wilders  are powerful psions that lack any formal training. Their abilities can vary, and their use can sometimes be unpredictable. But they tend to make up for their lack of formal training with unusual abilities and a ferociousness of mind. The Wilder subclass has its choice of the aptitudes.

### Wild Psionic Surge (Level 1)

Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your psionic powers can unleash surges of untamed psychic energy. Immediately after you manifest a psion power of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a `d20`. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Psionic Surge table to create a random psionic effect. A Wild Psionic Surge can happen once per turn.

If a Wild Psionic effect is a power, it's too wild to be affected by any further psionic abilities. If it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the power lasts for its full duration.

### Psychic Feedback (Level 5)

When you take damage from a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to amplify the pain back upon that creature. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your psionic save DC or take psychic damage equal to your current psionic energy die size (minimum of 1 damage). You may do this a number of times up to your Constitution bonus before needing a short or long rest.

### Psychic Eruption (Level 15)

As an action, you create a psychic eruption in a 30 foot radius centered either on yourself or at any point withing 60 feet that you can immediately perceive. Each enemy in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. You may do this once per short rest.
