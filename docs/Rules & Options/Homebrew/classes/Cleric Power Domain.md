# Power Domain

*[Cleric](cleric.md#): Divine Domain*  
*Source: Power Domain*  

## Class Features

### Power Domain (Level 1)

The Clerics of Er have access to a domain characteristic of their monistic pantheism -- a domain that springs from the Erimaen conception of all things as existing in virtue of striving to preserve and promote their power. This notion of 'power' is fundamental to all beings, and is the primary manner in which all of existence manifests. Clerics of the Power Domain focus on the promotion of life, the freedom from external constraints or conditions, and the connection of each being's existence to that of others and the fate of all.

At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

**Power Domain Spells**

| Cleric Level | Spells |
|--------------|--------|
| 1st | guiding bolt, sanctuary |
| 3rd | lesser restoration, zone of truth |
| 5th | aura of vitality, clairvoyance |
| 7th | aura of purity, divination |
| 9th | greater restoration, legend lore |

### Imbue with Power (Level 1)

At 1st level, the Power Domain grants the ability to use a bonus action to imbue a weapon with divine energy, dealing an extra `1d8` additional damage of the same type as the weapon on a hit. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `2d8`.

Alternatively, the Cleric can designate a creature and imbue them with power. Until the end of the Cleric's next turn, the target creature will gain advantage on an attack roll or saving throw of the target's choice.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Powerful Portents (Level 2)

At 2nd level, you can intuit aspects of the future in the actions of everyday objects and events, such as flights of birds or ripples made in water by a thrown stone. You can cast the augury without expending a spell slot and, when you cast the spell in this way, the spell has no verbal, somatic, or material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, once per long rest, when you cast a divination spell that includes a chance the DM gives you either no answer or a random reading---such as augury, commune, or divination---reduce that chance by 25 percent.

### Potent Freedom (Level 6)

At 6th level you may use a bonus action to grant yourself or an ally a fly speed equal to their walking speed for 1 minute. Alternatively, the Cleric can use their [channel divinity](compendium/classes/cleric.md#Channel%20Divinity%20(Level%202)) to end any single condition (except those conditions that require a wish spell or similar level of power to alleviate) affecting themselves or an ally.

### Potent Force (Level 8)

At 8th-level add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. Additionally, you gain resistance to force damage.

### Potent Command (Level 17)

At 17th level, you gain the ability to channel your divine power into a commanding presence. As an action, you may make any creature(s) (up to your Wisdom modifier) of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you roll a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they are charmed by you for 1 hour or until they take damage. While charmed, they will follow your commands to the best of their ability. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
