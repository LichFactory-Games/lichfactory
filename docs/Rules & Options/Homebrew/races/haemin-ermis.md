## Description

The native denizens of Haem are humanoids small of stature but big in their ideas. They see the world as something to be molded to fit their needs and interests. Haemish society is oriented towards using technology to solve material needs (sometimes in fairly ridiculous ways). Haemin are of various types, but typically stand scarcely taller than four feet, and live in loosely organized and non-hierarchical groups. The Haem Collective is the loose federation of such groups in the northern reaches of Ermis.

## Traits

### Size

Haemin are typically no taller than 4 feet and average about 60-80 pounds. Your size is Small.

### Darkvision

You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Haemin Cunning

You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

### Languages

### Artificer's Lore

Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.

### Tinkerer

You have proficiency with artisan's tools (tinker's tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.

When you create a device, choose one of the following options or something similar:

#### Clockwork Toy

This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

#### Fire Starter

The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

#### Music Box

When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.
