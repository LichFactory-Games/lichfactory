## Description

Autons are sentient constructs, usually created by skilled artificers for specific purposes. They resemble humanoid figures made of metal, stone, wood, or a combination of these, and are imbued by technomancy with power sufficient to bring the mechanism to life.

Autons can be programmed to carry out simple or complex tasks, such as guarding a location, performing manual labor, or engaging in combat. Some are designed to mimic human behavior and emotions, while others are purely functional and lack any semblance of personality.

Despite their artificial nature, Autons are capable of learning and adapting to new situations. They can be equipped with various tools and weapons, making them versatile assets in many fields.

However, the creation of Autons is not without controversy. Some view them as threats to human employment or as dangerous potential weapons if they were to malfunction or fall into the wrong hands. Others argue that they should be treated as other sapient beings with their own rights and freedoms. Autons are still relatively rare on Ermis, though it is thought that they will inevitably increase in number due to their usefulness in carrying out various tasks.

## Traits

### Creature Type

You are a Construct.

### Age

Autons do not age in the same way that biological creatures do. You can function indefinitely, provided your body is maintained and repaired as needed.

### Hardened Form

Autons's construct bodies are delicate mechanisms, but they are nevertheless more resilient than flesh. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use this score to determine your AC if worn armor would leave you with a lower score. You may benefit from a shield as normal.

### Healing Machine

If the mending spell is cast on you, you can spend a Hit Die, roll it, and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

In addition, your creator designed you to benefit from several spells that preserve life but that normally don't affect Constructs: cure wounds, healing word, mass cure wounds, mass healing word, and spare the dying.

### Inorganic Machine

You have immunity to poison damage and  disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed or poisoned. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.

However, you are uniquely vulnerable to things that interfere with your construction, like salt water or sand. If you get sprayed with salt water (or if you are subject to very salty air), it puts you at a disadvantage for all rolls. Immersion in salt water causes 1d8 damage per turn, and you are at a disadvantage on all rolls until you can be cleaned. Similar points hold for sand, etc.

### Sleep Mode

You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep, but you must spend six hours per twenty-four hour period inactive and motionless to gain the benefits of a long rest. During this time, you are still aware of your surroundings.

### Integrated Tool

You have an integrated tool of your choice, which functions as a tool proficiency. Examples include selecting a blacksmith's hammer, a jeweler's kit, or navigator's tools.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.
