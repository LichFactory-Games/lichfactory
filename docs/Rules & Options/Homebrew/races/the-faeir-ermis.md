- **Ability Scores**: Charisma +2, Intelligence +1
- **Creature Type**: race
- **Size**: Medium

## Description

The Fǣir are known for their unsettling beauty, intelligence, and magic. Their origins are largely a mystery, though there are rumors that they are somehow descended from human, elven, and various fey lineages. They are sought after for their knowledge of arcane and mystical lore, which they guard closely.

The Fǣir can primarily be found living in secluded natural areas. Their settlements are often protected by enchantments and illusions that make them difficult for outsiders to locate. They have a reputation for being aloof and enigmatic, preferring to observe from a distance rather than engage with outsiders.


## Traits

### Age

The Fǣir have long lifespans, often living for several centuries. They reach maturity at around 80 years of age.

### Alignment

The Fǣir are generally chaotic or neutral in nature, with a strong sense of independence and a love for freedom.

### Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

### Magic Resistance

You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Meditation

The Fǣir don't need to sleep. Instead they meditate deeply for 4 hours a day, remaining semiconscious during this time.  If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed. However, if you are not able to meditate for at least 4 hours during a 28 hour period you suffer a level of exhaustion. This level of exhaustion increases by 1 for every further 28 hour period until you either meditate, or die. Meditation is not a form of unconsciousness, hence you are not at a disadvantage to surprise or awareness of your surroundings, etc.

### Uncanny Presence

The Fǣir are ... different, unsettling, to non-Fǣir Folk. This does not mean it is necessarily unpleasant to be around one of the Fǣir, just that their presence always engenders a level of disquiet (in negative cases) or frisson (in positive ones). Add 1d4 to all Charisma ability checks and saving throws when made against another humanoid creature. Likewise, subtract 1d4 from all Charisma-based ability and skill checks made by other humanoid creatures insofar as they are directed specifically at the Fǣir creature.

### Fey Magic

At first level you know the Druidcraft cantrip. At 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast the Faerie Fire spell once per short or long rest. At 5th level, you can also cast the Misty Step spell once per once per short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Fey Traits

The Fǣir often have one or more distinctive physical traits. These manifest as distortions or caricatures of typical humanoid features. Choose a physical feature (in consultation with your DM), or roll on the following table:
