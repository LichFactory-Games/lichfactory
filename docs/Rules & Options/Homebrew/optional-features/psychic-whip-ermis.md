# Psychic Whip
*Source: Ermis: Ad Astra* 

**Type:** Bonus Action

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Range:** 30 feet

**PE Cost:** Special

As a bonus action, you create a psychic whip that lashes out at a target within 30 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or take `1d4` psychic damage and be pulled up to 10 feet towards you.

This attack's damage increases by `1d4` when you reach 5th level (`2d4`), 11th level (`3d4`), and 17th level (`4d4`).
