# Sending
*Source: Ermis: Ad Astra* 

The sending aptitude allows the psion to project psychic energy or information they possess into the world around them. Such information might include emotions or thoughts, allowing communication or influence of a creature's mind, similarly the sending might alter a creature's perception of its environment. The sending aptitude also allows a Psion to engage in various kinds of mental attack, as they project their psyche into another's mind.
