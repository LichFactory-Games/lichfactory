**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Special

**Range:** 50 feet

**PE Cost:** Special

As an action, you can perceive any mind that is not protected or otherwise shielded against divination or psionic targeting within 50 feet. Any creature within this area that fails a Wisdom saving throw against your psion DC will make its surface thoughts available to be understood regardless of the language spoken. If the creature has an Intelligence of 3 or less, it will transmit impressionistic "pictures" and/or raw emotions and desires. A creature that is hidden from or otherwise immune to psionics or divination magic is immune to this feature.
