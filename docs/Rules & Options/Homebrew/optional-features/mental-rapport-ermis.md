# Mental Rapport
*Source: Ermis: Ad Astra* 

**Type:** Bonus Action

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Range:** 30 feet

**PE Cost:** Special

As a bonus action, you may communicate telepathically with one willing creature within 30 feet. The creature must be able to speak a language that you can understand. Otherwise, only basic sensory images or feelings may be communicated. Any barriers of rock, wood, or metal thicker than a few inches will block your ability. A creature that has an Intelligence score lower than 3 or is hidden from psionics or divination magic is immune to this feature.
