# Time Reversal
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, an hourglass filled with black sand
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You reverse time for a brief moment, causing a creature or object within range to revert to its state from a previous round. Choose a target creature or object within range that you can see. You can rewind time up to 6 seconds, effectively causing the target to undo their last action, or the state of the object to revert to a previous state. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target returns to its previous state; on a successful save, nothing happens. The effects of this spell cannot be used to reverse death or the effects of other spells that have permanent or long-lasting effects.

Additionally, if you cast this spell at a higher level, you can target an additional creature or object for each level above 7th.

**Classes**: [Wizard](../../../z_compendium/classes/wizard.md#)
