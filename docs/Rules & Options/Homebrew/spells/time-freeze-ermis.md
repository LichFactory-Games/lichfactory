# Time Freeze
*9th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 radius
- **Components:** V, S, a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You freeze time within a 30-foot radius sphere centered on you. All creatures and objects within the area are frozen in time for the duration. While time is frozen, no time passes for the affected creatures or objects, and they are unaware of their surroundings. The duration of this spell is subjective and is measured from the perspective of creatures and objects outside the area. Spells and other effects that have a duration longer than the remaining duration of Time Freeze are suspended and resume their effects once the spell ends. The caster can choose to end the spell before its duration expires. Additionally, if a creature or object is moved from the area while time is frozen, it remains unaffected by the spell.

**Classes**: [Wizard](../../5e-compendium/classes/wizard.md#)
