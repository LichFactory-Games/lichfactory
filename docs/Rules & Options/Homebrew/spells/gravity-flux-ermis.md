# Gravity Flux
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a small piece of lead
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You create an area of gravitational flux centered on a point you can see within range. The area is a 20-foot radius sphere. Creatures within the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled towards the center of the sphere, where they become restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to escape. Additionally, any creature that starts its turn restrained by the spell takes 2d8 force damage.
