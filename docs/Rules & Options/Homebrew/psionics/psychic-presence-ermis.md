# Psychic Presence
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**PE Cost:** Roll

You project a psionic aura that can either draw or repel attention from others. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Psionic save DC or be drawn to you for the next minute, as if by a charm person spell

Alternatively, you can choose to repel the creature, causing it to make an immediate Wisdom saving throw against your Psionic save DC or be unable to approach within 30 feet of you for the next minute.

Additional uses of this talent prior to taking a long rest require expending a PE die size.
