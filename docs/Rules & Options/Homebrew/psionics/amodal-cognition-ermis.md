# Amodal Cognition
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Scanning

**Type:** Bonus Action

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** 10 ft radius

**PE Cost:** Roll/Size

Roll your PE die. You gain information about your environment without it coming to you via any sense modality. Instead, you simply "know" various facts concerning your location or the creatures occupying it. Whenever you make an Insight or Investigation check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your PE die roll value. This applies only to a location, item, or creature within 10 feet of you. To extend the range of your cognition, you must use an action and expend one PE die size per 10 feet of range. The extended range lasts until you lose concentration. Known information can include the name, owner, location, alignment, emotional valence, and even (surface level) thoughts of objects or creatures in range.
