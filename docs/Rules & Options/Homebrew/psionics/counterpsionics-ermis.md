# Counterpsionics
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Nullifying

**Type:** Reaction

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Range:** 30 ft

**PE Cost:** Special

When a psionic effect is used within 30 ft of you, you can use your reaction to attempt to counteract it. This requires a successful Intelligence (Psionics) check, contested by the original caster's Intelligence (Psionics) check. On a successful contest, the effect is nullified.

Each subsequent use of this talent prior to a short or long rest requires expending a PE die size.
