# Remote Viewing
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Scanning

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** 1 min per PE die; requires *concentration*

**Range:** PE die value in miles

**PE Cost:** Roll/Size

You can see and hear events occurring at a location within range as if you were there, even if you have never been to that location before. As an action, you can choose a location that you know exists and is within a number of miles equal to your PE die size. For the next minute, you can see and hear everything happening at that location, as if you were standing there yourself. You can extend the duration by expending a die size. You can move your point of view around the location as if you were physically present. However, you cannot interact with anything at the location or communicate with any creatures there. You must concentrate to maintain this ability, and you cannot move or take other actions while using it. If you use this more than once per long rest, you must expend a PE die size for every additional use until you take a long rest.
