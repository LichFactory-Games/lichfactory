# Shaping
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Altering

**Type:** Use an object

**Duration:** Until long rest or reshaped again

**Range:** Touch

**PE Cost:** Roll

You can use this talent to reshape non-living material objects, manipulating them to take on different forms or shapes. You can reshape an object with a volume of up to 1 cubic foot per psychic energy die expended, using a minimum of one die. You cannot alter the nature of the object (e.g., you cannot make stone turn into clay), but you can reshape the object beyond what it would normally allow (e.g., you can curve a stone or piece of wood that would otherwise break).
