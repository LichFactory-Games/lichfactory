# Mental Image
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** 10 minutes (Concentration)

**Range:** 60 feet

**PE Cost:** Size

You gain the ability to project images into the minds of creatures with perfect clarity, interposing it over their reality. Creatures affected by this talent must make an Intelligence saving throw or be convinced that the image is real, even if it contradicts other sensory input. The image lasts for up to 10 minutes, until your concentration is interrupted, or until you choose to end it, whichever comes first. You can target up to three creatures with this talent at once and must have a clear line of sight to them.

A creature that has an intelligence score lower than 3, does not possess any language, or is hidden from psionics or divination magic is immune to this feature.
