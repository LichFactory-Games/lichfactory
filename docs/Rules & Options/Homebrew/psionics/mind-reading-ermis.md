# Mind Reading
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Scanning

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** 120 ft radius

**PE Cost:** Roll

Roll your PE die. You can use your telepathic abilities to read the thoughts of another creature. As an action, choose one creature you can perceive within 120 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Psion spell save DC. On a failed save, you can read the surface thoughts of the creature for a number of minutes equal to the value of a roll of your PE die.

You can also use this power to detect the presence of intelligent creatures you can't see. As an action, you can search for creatures within 15 feet of you. Any barriers of rock, wood, or metal thicker than a few inches will block your ability. A creature that has an intelligence score lower than 3, does not possess any language, is hidden from psionics, divination magic, or otherwise having their mind read is immune to this feature.
