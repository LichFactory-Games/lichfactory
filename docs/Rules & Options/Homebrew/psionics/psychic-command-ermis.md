# Psychic Command
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** 1 minute

**Range:** 60 feet

**PE Cost:** Roll

As an action, you attempt to charm a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Psionics save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is under your control, and you can issue it simple commands, such as "Approach," "Flee," "Halt," or "Drop what you're holding." The creature will not obey any commands that might cause it harm. Once the effect ends, the creature becomes aware of your control and can take actions against you if it wishes.
