# Teleport
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Porting

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Range:** 30 feet

**PE Cost:** Size

You teleport yourself, and any creatures or objects you choose of up to large size within 30 feet of you, to an unoccupied space you can see within 500 feet. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet." If you teleport a number of creatures (or objects of medium or larger size) greater than your proficiency bonus, you must take a level of exhaustion per extra creature/object transported.

For each use of Teleport you must expend a PE die size.
