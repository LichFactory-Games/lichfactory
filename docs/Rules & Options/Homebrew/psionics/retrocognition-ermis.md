# Retrocognition
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Scanning

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** 30 ft radius

**PE Cost:** Roll

You can sense information about past events that occurred in your current location or nearby. As an action, you can roll your PE die and learn information about an event that took place within the area you can see or touch, up to a number of years equal to the number rolled. The information you receive is based on the nature of the event and the degree of its significance. For example, you might learn the identity of a person who was recently in the area, the location of a hidden object, or the details of a past battle. You cannot use this talent to gain information about events that occurred beyond the range of your senses or that you have no way of physically accessing. You may use this talent no more than once in a given area before taking a short or long rest.
