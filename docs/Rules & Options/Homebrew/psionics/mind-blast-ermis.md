# Mind Blast
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending

**Type:** Attack

**Range:** 30-foot cone

**PE Cost:** 2 Sizes

As an action, you expend two PE die sizes to project a blast of psychic energy in a 30-foot cone in front of you. Each creature in the cone must make a Wisdom saving throw or take (3d8 + Consitution modifier) of psychic damage and be stunned for 1 round. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not stunned. Add 1d8 of additional psychic damage at levels 5, 12, and 18.
