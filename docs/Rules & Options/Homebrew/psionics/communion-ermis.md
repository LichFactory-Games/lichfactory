# Communion
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** 1 hour per PE die size expended; concentration

**Range:** Perceptual range, no longer required after establishment

**PE Cost:** Size

You may communicate your emotions or thoughts to the mind of another intelligent being that you can immediately perceive. The recipient recognizes these emotions or thoughts as not their own, and may make an Intelligence check to determine their source. This talent effectively allows one-way communication between sender and recipient. The communion lasts 1 hour per PE die size expended. After the communion is established, the recipient need no longer be within immediate perceptual range, and communication is in all respects similar to talking with the creature.

Any barriers of rock, wood, or metal thicker than a few inches will block your ability. A creature that has an intelligence score lower than 3, does not possess any language, is hidden from psionics or divination magic is immune to this feature.
