# Psionic Wave
*Minor Talent*  

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Range:** 5 ft. radius centered on self

**PE Cost:** Special

As an action, you release a wave of psionic force energy within a 5 ft. radius centered on you. Each creature in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Psion DC or take `1d6` force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

This attack's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
