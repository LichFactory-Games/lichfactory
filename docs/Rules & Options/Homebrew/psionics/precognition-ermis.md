# Precognition
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Scanning

**Type:** Bonus Action

**Duration:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**PE Cost:** Roll/Size

You gain a premonition of future events. As an action, you can roll your PE die and add the result to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make within the next minute. You can use this talent once per long rest without expending any PE die size. If you use this more than once per long rest, you must expend a PE die size for every use until you take a long rest.
