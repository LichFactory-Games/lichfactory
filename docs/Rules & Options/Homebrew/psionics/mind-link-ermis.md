# Mind Link
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending, and either Communion or Mind Reading

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Roll hours

**Range:** 1 mile

**PE Cost:** Roll

You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As an action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and then roll your Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common language to understand each other.
