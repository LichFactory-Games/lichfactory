# Mental Insinuation
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** 30 ft

**PE Cost:** Roll

You subtly insinuate your preferences to another and thus influence their choices without ever overtly making your influence noticed. While concentrating on this talent, you gain expertise in the Persuasion skill against a creature you can perceive within 30 feet of you, though the talent has no effect against creatures that are immune to psionics, or immune to mental influence or charm (such as a creature under the effect of mind blank).
