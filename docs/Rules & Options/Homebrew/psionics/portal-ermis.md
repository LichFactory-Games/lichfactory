# Portal
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Porting

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** 1 minute

**Range:** 60 feet

**PE Cost:** Size

You create a portal between two points that you can sense that are within 60 feet of you. The portal is a circular opening that is 5 feet in diameter, and it lasts for up to 1 minute, unless it is dismissed, or your concentration is interrupted. Any creature or object that enters the portal from either side is immediately transported to the other side of the portal, appearing in an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of the portal. The portal can be used up to three times before it disappears. The portal cannot be used offensively.
