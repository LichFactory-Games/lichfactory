# Empathic Insight
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Scanning

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** 60/15 ft radius

**PE Cost:** Roll

Roll your PE die. As an action, you can empathically read a creature that is within 60 feet of you. You learn its most powerful surface-level emotion. For example, you might learn that a creature is excited, fearful, angry, sad, or content. Whenever you make a Charisma check to interact with a creature whose aura you have read, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

You can also use this power to detect the presence of sentient creatures you can't see. Roll your PE die. As an action, you can search for creatures within 15 feet of you. Any barriers of rock, wood, or metal thicker than a few inches will block your ability. A creature that is not sentient, explicitly does not experience emotions, is hidden from psionics, divination magic, or having their mind read is immune to this feature.
