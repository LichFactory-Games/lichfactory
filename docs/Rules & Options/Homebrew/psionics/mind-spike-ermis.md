# Mind Spike
*Minor Talent*  

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** -

**Range:** 60 ft

**PE Cost:** Special

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take `1d6` psychic damage and subtract `1d4` from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach certain levels: 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
