# Third Eye
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Scanning

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** 10 ft radius per PE die

**PE Cost:** Roll/Size

You see as if through a third eye, which grants you enhanced sight in a 10-foot radius with you at the center. Within this range, you have blindsight and can see into the ethereal plane. While seeing through your third eye, you also gain proficiency in Perception, and whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

As a bonus action, you can expend a PE die size and expand the radius of your enhanced sight by 10 feet per PE die size expended.
