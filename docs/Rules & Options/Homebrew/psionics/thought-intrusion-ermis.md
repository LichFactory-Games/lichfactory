# Thought Intrusion
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Range:** 60 feet

**PE Cost:** Roll

As an action, you can use your psychic energy to send intrusive thoughts to a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see or otherwise know the exact location of. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your psion DC or take 1d6 + PE die roll of psychic damage and become frightened for a number of rounds equal to the PE roll (minimum of 1). On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not frightened.

Any barriers of rock, wood, or metal thicker than a few inches will block your ability. A creature that has an intelligence score lower than 3, does not possess any language, or is hidden from psionics or divination magic is immune to this feature.
