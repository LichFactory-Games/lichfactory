# Psychometry
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Scanning

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** Touch

**PE Cost:** Roll

Roll your PE die. You can make relevant inferences from an object of unknown history by making physical contact with that object. When used as an action, you gain a bonus equal to your PE die value on Investigation or History rolls with respect to an object you can touch. If you succeed on your skill check, you can gain specific information about the identity, appearance, or mental state of the creature or creatures that most recently handled the item or were most significantly related to its creation or history.
