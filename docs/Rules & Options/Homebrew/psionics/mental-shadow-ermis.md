# Mental Shadow
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending

**Type:** Bonus Action

**Duration:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**PE Cost:** Roll

You blend your own presence and memories with that of another creature, causing it to perceive you as a part of its own mind. As a bonus action, you merge with the mind of a creature you touch. While merged, you can perceive the creature's surroundings as if you were there and can communicate telepathically with the creature. You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to influence the creature while merged. The creature is unaware that you are influencing its thoughts unless you choose to reveal yourself or your actions would make it obvious. This talent lasts for 1 minute, until your concentration is interrupted, or until you choose to end it as a bonus action. You may extend the duration by expending a PE die. Once you use this talent, you can't use it again on the same creature until you complete a long rest.
