# Mind Meld
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Sending

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Range:** Touch

**PE Cost:** Roll

As an action, you link your mind with that of another humanoid you can touch. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Psionics save DC or become charmed by you for one hour or until it takes damage. If the save is successful the target is immune to this talent for 24 hours. After the duration ends the target will know that is has been charmed. While the target is charmed in this way, you can communicate with it telepathically. You may use this talent once per target before requiring a long rest. You can mind-meld with a number of humanoids equal to proficiency bonus at a time.
