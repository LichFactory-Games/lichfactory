# Energy Drain
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Nullifying

**Type:** Action

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Range:** 60 ft

**PE Cost:** Roll

You can use this talent to drain the psionic or magical energy of a creature within 60 ft of you. This requires a successful Intelligence (Psionics) check, contested by the target's Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d10 psychic damage and loses one spell slot or PE die size.

Each subsequent use of this talent prior to a long rest requires expending a PE die size.
