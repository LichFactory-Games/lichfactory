# Pyro/Cryokinesis
*Major Talent*  

**Prerequisite:** Altering

**Type:** Use an object or Attack

**Duration:** 1 round

**Range:** 15 feet

**PE Cost:** Roll

You can use psionic energy to heat up or cool down a perceivable creature or object within 15 feet of you. If a creature is targeted, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Psionics DC or take `1d10` plus your PE die roll in heat/cold damage at the beginning of its turn until the Psion ends the effect or their concentration is broken.

If an object is targeted then it takes similar damage, and each round it is concentrated upon there is a cumulative 25% chance of it cracking (cold) or igniting (heat). If the material is metal that is being worn the effect is similar to that of heat metal.

Additional uses of this talent prior to taking a short or long rest require expending a PE die size per use.
