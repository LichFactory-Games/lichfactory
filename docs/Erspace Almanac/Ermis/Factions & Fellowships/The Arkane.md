The Arkane are the magical arm of the Dyarchy. Though they consist of wizards of all schools, but one of their primary responsibilities is in maintaining the functioning of the Spar transport system, as well as the enchantments that allow Omerth to maintain its position floating at the center of the world. The Arkane  train all kinemancers and orimancers of the Dyarchy, as well as the technomancers (artificers) that perform the various engineering feats required to keep travel along the Spar running smoothly. 

The Arkane and the Gnostari are the "hand" of the Dyarchy (with the Hegemon being its "fist"). Their collective interests concern furthering the power of the Dyarchy and the word of Er. However, members of the Arkane are also quite likely to have their own interests, including the furthering of magical knowledge and power. House Tethys has great influence among various members of the Arkane due to its ability to procure unusual items of magic throughout the realm.
