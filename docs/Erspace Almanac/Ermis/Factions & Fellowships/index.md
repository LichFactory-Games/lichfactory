# Factions of Ermis

The Dyad and the five great houses are by far the most significant political and economic factions on Ermis and together they form the governing body of the twin cities -- the Synod. The political structure of the twin cities resembles in some respects that of a constitutional monarchy, but the Dyad has ultimate authority and the rest of the Synod is more advisory in nature. However, because the Synod exists in part to resolve disputes between the houses peacefully, as well as to address outside threats, there is a significant investment by all in an at least surface-level or apearance of respecting the established norms, practices, and rulings of the Synod.

The other great powers include the Council of the Fair and the Haem Collective. The nomadic Sil, that live in the wastes, are rumored to also have some sort of broader political structure, but their organization is largely unknown.

## The Five Great Houses

### House Orosen

Based in Eryth, House Orosen is a powerful family of inventors and engineers. They are masters of both arcane and technological advancements, with their inventions being sought after across Ermis. They specialize in crafting automatons and golems, and their airships are the fastest and most advanced in the skies.

### House Valtor

Combining clockwork technology and elemental magic, House Valtor is based in Eryth and known for their impressive engineering feats. They are masters of airships, clockwork golems, and steam engines.

### House Hyperion

The third and final house in Eryth, House Hyperion is known for their magical prowess and their control of the arcane. They, along with House Tethys, are responsible for the magical defenses of the twin cities and often act as advisors to the Dyad and the Arcanum.

### House Tethys

Based in Astryth, House Tethys is known for their exploration of the continents, and their trade in various unusual antiquities. They have extensive land and sea resources, and are known to deal in rare magics. 

### House Xeryth

Using earth-based magic and advanced geotechnologies, House Xeryth is based in Astryth and known for their impressive feats of construction and infrastructure. They are primarily responsible for the original train design for the Spar, and are responsible for its upkeep and expansion.

## The Council of the Faeir

The Council of the Fair is a confederation of independent fair folk that come together periodically to share knowledge and resources. Each circle is led by a powerful Fair creature with unique abilities and skills, and decisions are made through consensus rather than formal voting. The Council's main goals are to preserve and protect the natural order of Ermis, and to ensure that the faerie folk can continue to exist and thrive in the face of the increasingly powerful and authoritarian Dyarchy. They are rumored to communicate with each other through a network of enchanted trees and stones scattered throughout the forests and mountains, and they rarely interact with other races unless such interaction furthers their own perhaps inscrutable ends.

## The Haem Collective

The Haem Collective is a loosely organized group of artisans and engineers who are dedicated to the pursuit of innovation and progress. Highly skilled mechanics and craftspeople who specialize in the creation and maintenance of advanced machinery and technology, Haemin believe that the key to improving the lives of *all* Ermisians lies in the development of new technologies and the application of magic in practical ways. The Haemin are known for their ability to build devices that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. They are guided by a philosophy of communalism and mutual aid, and they often collaborate with other factions in Ermis to share their expertise and resources. Despite their anarchic structure, the Haemin have a reputation for being reliable and trustworthy, and their services are in high demand among the wealthy and powerful in Ermis Their main hub is located in the city of Mykonia, where they maintain a massive laboratory and workshop complex that is open to all members of the collective. The Haemin are fiercely independent and tend to resist outside influence, but they are always willing to collaborate with other groups who share their values.
