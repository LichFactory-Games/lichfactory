There are three megacities on Ermis. These are [[./Gazetteer/Eryth|Eryth]], [[./Gazetteer/Astryth|Astryth]], and [[./Gazetteer/Omerth|Omerth]]. 

Other major cities include [[Kavouri|Kavouri]] and [[Tehmérr|Tehmérr]] (major seaports), [[Thalassia|Thalassia]] (the seat of the Council of the Faeir), and [[Mykonia|Mykonia]] (the northern center of the Haem Collective). 

The primary deity worshipped on Ermis is [[./Gazetteer/Er|Er]].  [[./Pyntarch's Lives/The Dyarchy|The Dyarchy]] recognizes no other deity and contend that all other gods are simply aspects or appearances of Er.
