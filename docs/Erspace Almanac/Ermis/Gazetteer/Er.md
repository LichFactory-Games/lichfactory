The God of [[Erspace Almanac|Erspace]] and the planet of [[Ermis|Ermis]]. Er is considered to be all that is -- the being of everything. All is Er and Er is all.   Because this religion is montheistic but also pantheistic there is a sense of all the universe being subject to Er or the manifestation of Er. As [[The Dyarchy|The Dyarchy]] discovers the wider wildspace and interspace systems these are taken to simply be further opportunities to manifest the faith of Er.   Er is considered a God of the prime material plane. This might seem to be a limitation of Er. But worshippers of Er consider the Prime material to be sole reality and of all other planes to be derivative or emanated from this prime reality.
