The Spar is the great rock column that spans the diameter of [[Ermis|Ermis]]. It consists of extremely dense rock and is approximately 25 miles in width (it has an irregular cylindrical shape). It is the primary trade way for [[Ermis|Ermis]]. 

[[Omerth|Omerth]] is located at the mid-way of the Spar. The Spar itself also hosts the train that transports most goods between [[Eryth|Eryth]] and [[Astryth|Astryth]].
