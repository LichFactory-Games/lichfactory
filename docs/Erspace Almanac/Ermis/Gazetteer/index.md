Greetings, Wanderer,

I, Arion, send glad tidings to all who seek wisdom. My journeys through nature's realm have unveiled truths profound yet simple. For in each tree, stone and stream, the divine intellect shines forth.

Contained herein are not fanciful myths or superstitions, but the pure light of Er gleaned from careful study. I have wandered forests and mountains observing nature's great order, the web of Κοινός λόγος stretching through all things.

Gaze with me at the Strom, see its elegant geometries, the silent music of its tumultuous circuit. Contemplate the facets of the humblest stone and therein behold eternity's laws etched by the hand of God. In all phenomena, substance reveals itself through its attributes.

Let us proceed together step by step, elevating our minds through contemplation alone. The passions spellbond and mislead, but reason liberates. By intellect's patient labor, nature surrenders her secrets. Her book we read best by ebblight, as fading sight is supplanted by a deeper comprehension. 

Come, friends, cast away fear and ignorance, envy and greed. Our journey begins in wonder, continues through insight and ends in the light of true understanding. The truths herein kindle a small flame, inviting you to further illuminate reality's infinite expanse.

With joyful fellowship,

Arion, Sylfweard of Althussein
