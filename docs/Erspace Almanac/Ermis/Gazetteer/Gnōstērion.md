The Gnōstērion designates both a sacred building in the capital city, [[./Omerth|Omerth]], and the religious orders that reside in it. 

The Gnōstērion contains two orders -- the [[Dynamisai|Dynamisai]], or the Clerics of Er, and the [[../Pyntarch's Lives/Gnostari|Gnostari]], which are the [[../../../Rules & Options/Classes/Psion|psionic]] arm of the Dyarchy. Both orders are known for their religious zealotry.
