Erspace is the Wildspace system containing the planets Ermis and Aberranth, as well as several other planetoids and a dense debris field surrounding the central solar body. Erspace is isolated from the rest of the Prime Material Plane. It is also isolated from the other planes, with the exception of the Feywild and the Shadowrealm. This planer isolation is due to some cataclysm that occurred in ages long past, the details of which seem largely lost to history. Remnants of spelljamming ship are present throughout the system, and particularly around Ermis, as well as on its surface. 

The sundering of what must have been a planet, but now is merely rocky debris, occurred during this cataclysm. All that is left of that planet now closely orbits the primary solar body of Erspace -- the star Erastyr.
