The largest inhabited planet in Erspace, and as far as any know, the only one since Ermis is thought to be an uninhabited rock. 

From space Andromea is perhaps most notable for its interlocking triplicate ring structure. The rings are understood to be the remnants of several moons that were destroyed in the ancient shattering that closed Erspace off from the rest of the prime material plane. 

Andromea is covered by high desert, with only a few significant bodies of water and no oceans. There are two main factions on Andromea. The [[neogi-mpmm|Neogi]] have a large consortium that trades in mined materials from Andromea and the nearby belt, plus biological material, primarily slaves, for trade with the A'lhryn. 

Opposed to the consortium is a largely human mercantilist society called the [[Hozhungi|Hozhungi]].  The Neogi and the Honzhungi are not typically engaged in open conflict, but their trade interests often conflict, and where they do, trouble can arise. However, since both societies are wealth-driven and roughly similar in power level, no open conflict is sustained for long, as the instabilities brought on by war are bad for business.
