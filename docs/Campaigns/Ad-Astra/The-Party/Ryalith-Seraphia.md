## Biographical Details

**Appearance:** Ryalith is a tall Faeir woman, standing at 6'3", with feline-like features. She has piercing blue eyes, orange hair/fur, and a slim but muscular build. Ryalith goes for simplicity when regarding her clothing: she wears a leather jacket with a studded collar and dark, baggy linen pants tucked into black leather boots that had definitely seen better days. She's almost always seen with a cigarette and an unnerving smile that persists even when she's brawling it out or getting beaten to a pulp herself. As a Faeir, Ryalith is aware of the effect her presence may have on others and takes full advantage of it. There's a dangerous glint in her eyes; one that clearly displays an eerie confidence that warns others of her reckless nature.

Ryalith grew up in a quiet, secluded forest with her fellow Faeir for most of her life. She always had a penchant for adventure, often out and about much further than her family was comfortable with. To add to that, she had a tendency to rough-house with other children and even local wildlife, but never seemed to learn her lesson even when the result wasn't always pretty for her.  

As she grew older, her fascination with the outside world only grew. Ryalith always had a sense for danger, and she saw the outside world as her ticket straight to the one thing that made her feel alive: the heat of battle. So, she took that opportunity. She left her secluded community to chase after the high that she sought.  

Ryalith had her fair share of ups and downs. The world that she knew was often forgiving and she always had a home to fall back to; but now she was a stranger in a place that was often cruel and hostile. No matter how much she was beaten down, though, Ryalith persisted.
