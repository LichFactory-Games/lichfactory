## Biographical Details

Stigs "The Stiff" Svenson spent his formative years training as a mechanic for House Orosen, nothing glamorous, just hard work, grease stains, and metal. He was never particularly fond of the house, but his mentor was everything to him, and his care and guidance were what kept Stigs on the path to success all those years. Stigs has been working a steady job in airship construction and repair for quite a while now, though the coveted engineering position remains just out of reach.

Stigs was not born a dhampir, nor is his dhampir nature the typical bloodsucking variety. His condition came to him later in life, when he was taken to be the subject of an experimental procedure by a fringe group within the house. The procedure was supposed to enhance the subject's bioelectricity to allow direct interfacing with machines and magical devices. Instead, the procedure failed spectacularly, setting off a massive power surge, leaving Stigs… altered. He gained strange physical traits and abilities, and most notably, a dependence on external electricity to sustain himself. Without this electricity, mostly absorbed from other living beings in barely noticeable quantities through the skin, he would begin to starve.

He was rescued from the laboratory by his mentor, who was injured in the process, and they silently agreed to never speak of the incident. The physical changes were explained away to House Orosen with some vague story of a hereditary illness. In the years since, they started to realize Stigs wasn't aging, but his mentor was, rapidly so, and the injury caused him increasing pain as time went on, which Stigs feels deeply, personally guilty and responsible for.

Stigs has become much jumpier, more paranoid, more suspicious in the years since the incident. He's both fascinated and terrified by conspiracy theories and rumors of occult plots, ideas that would shake the very foundation of civilization of Ermis, secrets of a universe beyond their comprehension, beyond the soil they all call home.

Today, he continues his work, living in a perpetual state of anticipation. He fears for the day his mentor passes away, he fears for the day the wrong person notices his abnormal nature, he fears for a day when the Cult of Hodos is proven correct, and all must face the darkness beyond their world.
