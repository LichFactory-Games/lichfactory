overview: 
traits: |
  I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder, like my fascination in the beauty of refracted light in the crystal jewelry I handcraft.

  I find the secrets hidden in mystery of time and space to be utterly compelling. The more a place promises answers, the more I am drawn to it.

  **Deeply Superstitious**. I believe in my ability to interpret the Tarot symbolic signs to reveal truths about people, places and things in my world in the present and future.
